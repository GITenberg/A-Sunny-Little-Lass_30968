<h2><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>The One Room House</span></h2>

<p>It was in &#8220;the littlest house in Ne&#8217; York&#8221; that
Glory lived, with grandpa and Bo&#8217;sn, the dog, so she, and its owner,
often boasted; and whether this were actually true or not, it certainly
was so small that no other sort of tenant than the blind captain could
have bestowed himself, his grandchild, and their few belongings in
it.</p>

<p>A piece-of-pie shaped room, built to utilize a scant, triangular
space between two big warehouses, only a few feet wide at the front and
no width at all at the rear. Its ceiling was also its roof and from it
dangled whatever could be hung thus, while the remaining bits of
furniture swung from hooks in the walls. Whenever out of use, even the
little gas-stove was set upon a shelf in the inner angle, thereby
giving floor space sufficient for two camp-stools and a three-cornered
scrap of a table at which they ate and worked, with Bo&#8217;sn curled
beneath.</p>

<p>This mite of a house stood at the crook of Elbow Lane, down by the
approaches to the big bridge over East River, in a street so narrow
that the sun never could shine into it; yet held so strong an odor of
salt water and a near-by fish-market, that the old sailor half fancied
himself still afloat. He couldn&#8217;t see the dirt and rubbish of the
Lane, nor the pinched faces of the other dwellers in it, for a few
tenements were still left standing among the crowding warehouses, and
these were filled with people. Glory, who acted as eyes for the old
man, never told him of unpleasant things, and, indeed, scarcely saw
them herself. To her, everything was beautiful and everybody kind, and
in their own tiny home, at least, everything was scrupulously clean and
shipshape.</p>

<p>When they had hung their hammocks back upon the wall, for such were
the only beds they had room for, and had had their breakfast of
porridge, the captain would ask: &#8220;Decks scrubbed well,
mate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221; came the cheery answer, and
Glory&#8217;s hands, fresh from the suds, would touch the
questioner&#8217;s cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brasses polished, hawsers coiled, rations dealt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, cap&#8217;n!&#8221; again called the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight bells! Every man to his post!&#8221; ordered the
master, and from the ceiling a bell struck out the half-hours in the
only way the sailor would permit time to be told aboard his
&#8220;ship.&#8221; Then Glory whisked out her needle and thread, found
grandpa his knife and bit of wood, and the pair fell to their tasks.
His was the carving of picture frames, so delicately and deftly that
one could hardly believe him sightless; hers the mending of old
garments for her neighbors, and her labor was almost as capable as his.
It had earned for her the nickname of &#8220;Take-a-Stitch,&#8221; for,
in the Lane, people were better known by their employments than their
surnames. Grandpa was &#8220;Cap&#8217;n Carver&#8221; when at his morning
work, but after midday, &#8220;Captain Singer,&#8221; since then, led
by his dog Bo&#8217;sn, he sang upon the streets to earn his livelihood. In
the later hours the little girl, also, wore another
title&#8211;&#8220;Goober Glory&#8221;&#8211;because she was one of the
children employed by Antonio Salvatore, the peanut man, to sell his
wares on commission.</p>

<p>But grandpa, Glory, and Bo&#8217;sn had the long delightful mornings at
home and together; and this day, as usual, their talk turned upon the
dream of their lives&#8211;&#8220;Sailors&#8217; Snug
Harbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, grandpa, talk. Tell how &#8217;tis. Do it fast an&#8217;
picturey-like, &#8217;less I never can guess how to make this piece do.
It&#8217;s such a little patch an&#8217; such a awful big hole! Posy
Jane gets carelesser an&#8217; carelesser all the time. This very last
week that ever was she tore this jacket again. An&#8217; I told her, I
said: &#8216;Jane, if you don&#8217;t look out you&#8217;ll never wear this
coat all next winter nohow.&#8217; An&#8217; she up an&#8217; laughed,
just like she didn&#8217;t mind a thing like that. An&#8217; she paid
me ten whole centses, she did. But I love her. Jane&#8217;s so good to
everybody, to every single body. Ain&#8217;t she, grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, deary. I cal&#8217;late she done it a purpose. She makes
her money easy, Jane does. Just sets there on the bridge-end and sells
second-hand flowers to whoever&#8217;ll buy. If she had to walk the
streets&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory was so surprised by this last sentence that she snapped her
thread off in the wrong place and wasted a whole needleful. Until
yesterday, she had never heard her grandfather speak in any but the
most contented spirit about his lot in life. Then he had twice lamented
that he &#8220;didn&#8217;t know whatever was to become o&#8217; two
poor creatur&#8217;s like them,&#8221; and now, again, this gay
morning, he was complaining&#8211;almost complaining. Glory
didn&#8217;t feel, in the least, like a &#8220;poor
creatur&#8217;.&#8221; She felt as &#8220;chirpy as a sparrow
bird,&#8221; over in City Hall park; and, if the sun didn&#8217;t shine
in the Lane, she knew it was shining in the street beyond, so what
mattered?</p>

<p>Vaguely disturbed, the child laid her hand on his arm and asked,
&#8220;Be you sick, grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered promptly and testily, &#8220;Sick? No, nor never was in
my life. Nothin&#8217; but blind an&#8217; that&#8217;s a trifle
compared to sickness. What you askin&#8217; for? Didn&#8217;t I eat my
breakfast clean up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es, but&#8211;but afterward you&#8211;you kicked Bo&#8217;sn,
an&#8217; sayin&#8217; that about &#8216;walkin&#8217; the street&#8217; just
a singin&#8217;; why, I thought you liked it. I know the folks like to
hear you. You do roll out that about the &#8216;briny wave&#8217; just grand.
I wish you&#8217;d sing it to Bo&#8217;sn an&#8217; me right now, grandpa,
dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wholly mollified and ashamed of his own ill-temper, the captain
tried the familiar tune but it died in his throat. Music was far beyond
him just then, yet he stroked the child&#8217;s head tenderly, and
said, &#8220;Some other time, mate, some other time. I&#8217;m a little
hoarse, maybe, or somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, never mind. Let&#8217;s talk &#8216;Snug Harbor.&#8217;
You begin. You tell an&#8217; I&#8217;ll put in what I&#8217;m mind to;
or I&#8217;ll say what I guess it&#8217;s like an&#8217; you set me
straight if I get crooked. &#8217;Cause you&#8217;ve seen it, grandpa,
an&#8217; I never have. Not once; not yet. Bime-by&#8213; Oh, shall I
begin, shall I, grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor sighed fit to shake the whole small tenement and nodded
in consent; so, observing nothing of his reluctance to their once
favorite subject, Glory launched forth:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sailors&#8217; Snug Harbor&#8217; is the most beautifulest
spot in the whole world! It&#8217;s all flowery an&#8217; grassy
an&#8217; treesy. It&#8217;s got fountains an&#8217; birds an&#8217;
orchestry-music forever an&#8217; ever. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t never cloudy
there, nor rainy, nor freezy, nor snowy, nor nothin&#8217; mean. Eh,
grandpa? Am I straight or crooked?&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain, roused as from a reverie, replied absently,
&#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful place, mate; I know that. Nobody wants
for nothin&#8217; there, an&#8217; once a man casts anchor there
he&#8217;s in safe haven for the rest of his days. Oh, I ain&#8217;t
denyin&#8217; none of its comforts, but I wish the whole
concern&#8217;d burn to the ground or sink in the bay. I wish the man
first thought of it had died before he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his anger, the blind man clasped his knife till its blade cut his
hand and Glory cried out in dismay. But he would not have her bathe the
wound and resumed his carving in silence. The little girl waited
awhile, once more fitting the small patch into the big hole of Posy
Jane&#8217;s jacket; then she went on as if nothing had occurred:</p>

<p>&#8220;When we go there to live, me an&#8217; you, we&#8217;ll have
a room as big an&#8217; nice as this an&#8217; you won&#8217;t have to
do a hand&#8217;s turn for yourself. You an&#8217; Bo&#8217;sn&#8217;ll just
set round in rockin&#8217;-chairs&#8211;I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em in
the stores&#8211;with welwet cushings on your laps&#8211;I mean you two
a settin&#8217; on the cushings, a dressed up to beat. Maybe,
they&#8217;ll let you order the whole crew, yourself, into white ducks
for muster at six bells, or somethin&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217;,&#8221; Glory continued, &#8220;there&#8217;ll be
me a wearin&#8217; a white frock, all new an&#8217; never mended,
an&#8217; my hair growed long an&#8217; lovely, an&#8217; me just as
purty as I wish I was, an&#8217; as everybody has to be that lives to
the &#8216;Harbor.&#8217; An&#8217; bime-by, of a Sunday, maybe, when they
can spare the time, Posy Jane an&#8217; Billy Buttons, an&#8217; Nick,
the Parson, &#8217;ll come walkin&#8217; up to the beautiful gate,
an&#8217; the captain what keeps it&#8217;ll write their names in a
book an&#8217; say, &#8216;Walk right in, ladies an&#8217; gentlemens, walk
right in. You&#8217;ll find Captain Simon Beck an&#8217; Miss Glorietta
Beck&#8217;&#8211;&#8217;cause I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to put that long tail to
my plain &#8216;Glory&#8217; when I go to live there, grandpa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lemme see. Where was I?&#8221; the little girl went on.
&#8220;Oh, yes. The Elbow folks had just come, an&#8217; was showed in.
They was told, &#8216;Walk right in. You&#8217;ll find your friends
settin&#8217; in the front parlor on them welwet cushings readin&#8217;
stories out o&#8217; books an&#8217; chewin&#8217; candy all day
long.&#8217; An&#8217; then they&#8217;ll scurce know us, Billy
an&#8217; them, an&#8217; not till I laugh an&#8217; show my teeth
an&#8217; you get up an&#8217; salute will they suspicion us. An&#8217;
you&#8217;ll have on gold specs an&#8217; dress-uniform an&#8217;
that&#8217;ll make you look just like you could see same&#8217;s other
folks. Why, grandpa, darlin&#8217;, I&#8217;ve just thought, just this
very minute that ever was, maybe, to the &#8216;Harbor&#8217; you won&#8217;t
be blind any more; for true, maybe not. In such a splendid place, with
doctors settin&#8217; round doin&#8217; nothin&#8217;, an&#8217;
hospitals an&#8217; all, likely they&#8217;ll put somethin&#8217; in
your eyes will make you see again. O grandpa&#8213; If!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man listened silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; when&#8211;when do you think would be the soonest
we might go? &#8217;Twon&#8217;t cost much to take me an&#8217; you an&#8217;
Bo&#8217;sn on the boat to Staten Island. I know the way. Onct I went clear
down to the ferry where they start from just a purpose to see,
an&#8217; we could &#8217;most any time. Will we go &#8217;fore next winter,
grandpa? An&#8217; yet I hate, I do hate, to leave this dear Lane. We
live so lovely in our hull house an&#8217; the folks&#8217;d miss us so
an&#8217; we&#8217;d miss the folks. Anyway, I should. You
wouldn&#8217;t, course, havin&#8217; so many other old sailors all
around you. An&#8217;&#8213; Why, here&#8217;s that same man
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even in Elbow Lane, where the shadows lie all day long, other and
darker shadows may fall; and such a shade now touched Glory&#8217;s
shoulder as she pictured in words the charm of that blessed asylum to
which the captain and she would one day repair. He had always fixed the
time to be &#8220;when he got too old and worthless to earn his
living.&#8221; But that morning she had swiftly reasoned that since he
had grown cross&#8211;a new thing in her experience&#8211;he must also
have suddenly become aged and that the day of their departure might be
near at hand.</p>

<p>The shadow of the stranger pausing at their door cut short her
rhapsody and sent her, the table, and Bo&#8217;sn, promptly out of doors,
because when any of the sailor&#8217;s old cronies called to see him,
there wasn&#8217;t room in &#8220;the littlest house&#8221; for all.
So, from the narrow sidewalk beyond the door, the child listened to the
talk within, not much of it being loud enough for her to hear, and
fancied, from grandpa&#8217;s short, sharp replies to his guest&#8217;s
questions, that he was crosser, therefore, more ill, than ever.</p>

<p>Bo&#8217;sn, too, sat on his haunches beside her, closely attentive and,
at times, uttering a low, protesting growl. Both child and dog had
taken a dislike to this unknown, who was so unlike the usual visitors
to the Lane.</p>

<p>Glory sometimes wandered as far as Fifth Avenue, with her peanut
basket, and now confided to Bo&#8217;sn:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just like them dressed-up folks on th&#8217;
avenue, what goes by with their noses in th&#8217; air, same&#8217;s if
they couldn&#8217;t abide the smell o&#8217; goobers, whilst all the
time they&#8217;re just longing to eat &#8217;em. Big shiny hat,
clothes &#8217;most as shiny, canes an&#8217; fixin&#8217;s, an&#8217;
gloves, doggie; gloves this hot day, when a body just wants to keep
their hands under the spigot, to cool &#8217;em.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217;,&#8221; continued Glory, &#8220;he ain&#8217;t like
the rest, Cap&#8217;n Gray, an&#8217; Cap&#8217;n Wiggins, what makes grandpa laugh
till he cries, swoppin&#8217; yarns. This one &#8217;most makes him cry
without the laughin&#8217; an&#8217;&#8213; Why, Bo&#8217;sn,
Bo&#8217;sn!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the midst of her own chatter to the terrier, Glory had overheard
a sentence of the &#8220;shiny gentleman&#8221; which sent her to her
feet, and the table, work, and stool into the gutter, while her rosy
face paled and her wide mouth opened still more widely. The stranger
was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Of course, they&#8217;ll never take in the child.</i> You
can go to the &#8216;Harbor&#8217; to-day, if you will, and you ought.
She&#8211;oh, there are plenty of Homes and Orphanages where they will
give her shelter. She&#8217;d be far better off than she is here, in
this slum, with only a blind old man to look after her. You come of
good stock, Beck, and, with a proper chance, the little girl might make
a nice woman. Here&#8211;whew, I really can&#8217;t endure the stench
of this alley any longer. We&#8217;ll make it this afternoon, captain.
At three o&#8217;clock I&#8217;ll send a man to take you over, and
I&#8217;ll get my sister, who knows about such things, to find a place
for your grandchild. Eh? I didn&#8217;t quite catch your
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa was murmuring something under his breath about: &#8220;Slum!
I knew it was small but &#8216;slum&#8217;&#8211;my little Glory&#8211;why,
why&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Bonnicastle interrupted without ceremony. He had put himself
out to do an old employee a service and was vexed that his efforts were
so ungratefully received. However, he was a man who always had his way
and intended to do so now; so he remarked, as if the captain had not
objected to so sudden a removal, &#8220;The man will be here at three
precisely. Have whatever traps you value put together ready.
You&#8217;ll not know yourself in your new quarters.
Good-morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that the visitor turned to depart but Bo&#8217;sn darted between his
feet, causing him either to step about in a peculiar fashion or crush
the dog; and, with equal want of courtesy, Glory pushed him aside to
fling herself on grandpa&#8217;s neck, and to shriek to the guest,
&#8220;Go &#8217;way! Go &#8217;way! Don&#8217;t you come back to Elbow Lane! I
hate you&#8211;oh, I do hate you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The great man was glad to go, nor did he notice her rudeness. His
carriage was waiting in the street outside the alley, and even his
sister Laura, who spent her days working to help the poor and who had
sent him here, could expect no more of him than he had done. Neither
his visit of yesterday nor to-day seemed appreciated by that old
captain who had once so faithfully commanded the colonel&#8217;s own
ship.</p>

<p>Miss Laura had chanced to hear of the seaman&#8217;s blindness and
poverty, and promptly tried to help him by having him placed in
&#8220;Sailors&#8217; Snug Harbor,&#8221; of which her brother was a
trustee. Nobody had told her about Glory, nor that the
&#8220;Harbor&#8221; was the subject oftenest discussed within the
&#8220;littlest house.&#8221;</p>

<p>But other old sailors had told the captain of it, and pictured its
delights, and once a crony had even taken him to visit it. After that,
to him and his grandchild, the asylum had seemed like a wonderful
fairyland where life was one happy holiday. When at their work, they
talked of this safe &#8220;Harbor&#8221; and the little girl&#8217;s
imagination endowed the place with marvelous beauties. In all their
dreaming they had still been together, without thought of possible
separation, till Colonel Bonnicastle&#8217;s sentence fell with a shock
upon their ears, &#8220;<i>They will never take in the
child</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>After the Colonel&#8217;s Visit</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go an&#8217; leave me, grandpa. Grandpa,
don&#8217;t you dast to go!&#8221; wailed Glory, her arms clasped so
tightly about the captain&#8217;s neck that they choked him. When he
loosened them, he drew her to his knee and laid her curly head against
his cheek, answering, in a broken voice, &#8220;Leave you, deary? Not
while I live. Not while you will stay with the old blind man, who
can&#8217;t even see to what sort of a home he has brought his
pet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to the nicest home ever was. Can&#8217;t be a nicer
nowhere, not any single where. Not even on that big avenue where such
shiny people as him live. Why, we&#8217;ve got a hull house to
ourselves, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Child, stop. Tell me exact, as you never told before. Is
Elbow Lane a &#8216;slum&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Deed I don&#8217;t know, &#8217;cause I never heard tell of a
&#8216;slum&#8217; &#8217;fore. It&#8217;s the cutest little street ever was. Why,
you can &#8217;most reach acrost from one side to the other. Me an&#8217;
Billy has often tried. It&#8217;s got the loveliest crook in it, right
here where we be; an&#8217; one side runs out one way an&#8217; t&#8217;other
toward the river. Why, grandpa, Posy Jane says onct&#8211;onct, &#8217;fore
anybody here was livin&#8217;, the Lane was a cow-path an&#8217; the
cows was drove down it to the river to drink. Maybe she&#8217;s
lyin&#8217;. &#8217;Seems if she must be, &#8217;cause now there ain&#8217;t no
cows nor nothin&#8217; but milk-carts an&#8217; cans in corner stores,
an&#8217; buildin&#8217;s where onct she says was grass&#8211;grass,
grandpa, do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I hear, mate. But the folks, the neighbors. A slum,
deary, I guess a slum is only where wicked people live. I don&#8217;t
know, really, for we had no such places on the broad high sea. Are our
folks in the Lane wicked, daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa!&#8221; she cried, indignantly. &#8220;When
there&#8217;s such a good, good woman, Jane&#8217;s sister
Meg-Laundress, what washes for us just &#8217;cause I mend her things.
An&#8217; tailor-Jake who showed me to do a buttonhole an&#8217; him
all doubled up with coughin&#8217;; an&#8217; Billy Buttons who gives
us a paper sometimes, only neither of us can read it; an&#8217; Nick,
the parson, who helps me sort my goobers; an&#8217; Posy Jane,
that&#8217;s a kind o&#8217; mother to everybody goin&#8217;.
Don&#8217;t the hull kerboodle of &#8217;em treat you like you was a
prince in a storybook, as I&#8217;ve heard Billy tell about? Huh! Nice
folks? I should think they was. Couldn&#8217;t be any nicer in the hull
city. Couldn&#8217;t, for sure, an&#8217; I say so, I, Glory
Beck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all very poor, mate, terrible, desperate poor; an&#8217;
ragged an&#8217; dirty an&#8217; swearers, an&#8217; not fit for my pet
to mix with. Never go to church nor Sunday-school, nor&#8213;Eh, little
mate?&#8221; persisted the old man, determined to get at the facts of
the case at last.</p>

<p>Glory was troubled. In what words could she best defend her friends
and convince her strangely anxious guardian that Elbow folks were
wholly what they should be? Since she could remember she had known no
other people, and if all were not good as she had fancied them, at
least all were good to her. With all her honest loyal heart she loved
them, and saw virtues in them which others, maybe, would not have seen.
With a gesture of perplexity, she tossed her head and clasped her
hands, demanding:</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;s poor? Why, I&#8217;ve heard you say
that we&#8217;re poor, too, lots o&#8217; times. But is any of us
beggars? No, siree. Is any of us thievers? No, Grandpa Beck, not a one.
An&#8217; if some is ragged or dirty, that&#8217;s &#8217;cause they
don&#8217;t have clothes an&#8217; spigots handy, an&#8217;
some&#8217;s afraid o&#8217; takin&#8217; cold, like the tailor man.
Some of us lives two er three families in a room, but&#8211;but
that&#8217;s them. Me an&#8217; you don&#8217;t. We have a hull house.
Why, me an&#8217; you is sort of rich, seems if, and&#8213;It&#8217;s
that big shiny-hatted man makes you talk so queer, grandpa
darlin&#8217;, an&#8217; I hate him. I wish he&#8217;d stayed to his
house an&#8217; not come near the Lane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, mate, hate nobody, nobody. He meant it kind. He
didn&#8217;t know how kindness might hurt us, deary. He is Colonel
Bonnicastle, who owned the ship I mastered, an&#8217; many another that
sails the sea this day. He&#8217;s got a lot to do with the
&#8216;Harbor&#8217; an&#8217; never dreamed how&#8217;t we&#8217;d known
about it long ago. A good ship it was an&#8217; many a voyage she made,
with me layin&#8217; dollars away out of my wage, till the sudden
blindness struck me an&#8217; I crept down here where nobody knew me to
get over it. That&#8217;s a long while since, deary, and the dollars
have gone, I always hopin&#8217; to get sight again and believin&#8217;
I&#8217;d done a fine thing for my orphan grandchild, keepin&#8217; so
snug a place over her head. So far, I&#8217;ve paid the rent reg&#8217;lar,
and we&#8217;ve had our rations, too. Now, mate, fetch me the bag and
count what&#8217;s in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little canvas bag which Glory took from the tiny wall-cupboard
seemed very light and empty, and when she had untied the string and
held it upside down not a coin fell from it. The old man listened for
the clink of silver but there was none to hear and he sighed deeply as
he asked, &#8220;Empty, Glory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Empty, grandpa. Never mind, we&#8217;ll soon put
somethin&#8217; back in it. You must get your throat cleared and go out
early an&#8217; sing your loudest. I&#8217;ll get Toni to let me have a
fifty-bagger, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll sell every single one. You might
make as much as a hull quarter, you might, an&#8217;
me&#8211;I&#8217;ll have a nickel. A nickel buys lots o&#8217; meal,
an&#8217; we can do without milk on our porridge quite a spell. That
way we can put by somethin&#8217; toward the rent, an&#8217;
we&#8217;ll be all right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; little Glory went on, &#8220;that old colonel
don&#8217;t have all to say &#8217;bout the &#8216;Harbor.&#8217; Maybe he
don&#8217;t like little girls an&#8217; that&#8217;s why. I&#8217;ll
get Cap&#8217;n Gray to find out an&#8217; tell. He likes &#8217;em. He
always gives me a cent to put in the bag&#8211;if he has one.
He&#8217;s poor, too, though, but he&#8217;s got a daughter growed up
&#8217;at keeps him. When I get growed I&#8217;ll earn. Why, darlin&#8217;
grandpa, I&#8217;ll earn such a lot we can have everything we want. I
will so and I&#8217;ll give you all I get. If&#8211;if so be, we
don&#8217;t go to the &#8216;Harbor&#8217; after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain stroked his darling&#8217;s head and felt himself
cheered by her hopefulness. Though they were penniless just now, they
would not be for long if both set their minds to money getting; and, as
for going to &#8220;Snug Harbor&#8221; without Glory, he would never do
that, never.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, mate, we&#8217;re our own masters still; and,
when the colonel sends his man for me, I&#8217;ll tell him &#8216;no,&#8217;
so plain he&#8217;ll understand. &#8217;Less I may be off on my rounds,
singin&#8217; to beat a premer donner. Hark! mess-time already. There
goes eight bells. What&#8217;s for us, cook?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the little bell, which hung from the ceiling, struck
eight tinkling notes and Glory&#8217;s face clouded. There was nothing
in the tiny cupboard on the wall save a remnant of porridge from
breakfast, that had cooled and stiffened, and the empty money-bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;O grandpa! So soon? Why, I ought to have finished
Jane&#8217;s jacket and took it to her. She&#8217;d have paid me
an&#8217; I&#8217;d ha&#8217; got the loveliest chop from the store
&#8217;round the corner. But now, you dear, you&#8217;ll just have to eat
what is an&#8217; make the best of it. Next time it&#8217;ll be better
an&#8217; here&#8217;s your plate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Humming a tune and making a great flourish of plate and spoon, she
placed the porridge before the captain and watched his face anxiously,
her heart sinking as she saw the distaste apparent at his first
mouthful. He was such a hungry old dear always, and so was she hungry,
though she didn&#8217;t find it convenient to eat upon all such
occasions. When there happened to be enough food for but one, she was
almost glad of the sailor&#8217;s blindness. If he smelled one chop
cooking on the little stove, how should he guess there weren&#8217;t
two? And if she made a great clatter with knife and plate, how could he
imagine she was not eating?</p>

<p>Up till now, Glory could always console herself with dreams of the
&#8220;Snug Harbor&#8221; and the feasts some day to be enjoyed there.
Alas! The colonel&#8217;s words had changed all that. For her there
would be no &#8220;Harbor,&#8221; ever; but for him, her beloved
grandpa, it was still possible. A great fear suddenly possessed her.
What if the captain should get so very, very hungry, that he would be
tempted beyond resistance, and forsake her after all! She felt the
suspicion unworthy, yet it had come, and as the blind man pushed his
plate aside, unable to swallow the unpalatable porridge, she resolved
upon her first debt. Laying her hand on his she begged, &#8220;Wait a
minute, grandpa! I forgot&#8211;I mean I didn&#8217;t get the milk.
I&#8217;ll run round an&#8217; be back with it in a jiffy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got the pay, mate?&#8221; he called after her, but, if she
heard him, she, for once, withheld an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Mister Grocer!&#8221; she cried, darting into the dairy
shop, like a stray blue and golden butterfly, &#8220;could you possibly
lend me a cent&#8217;s worth o&#8217; milk for grandpa&#8217;s dinner?
I&#8217;ll pay you to-night, when I get home from peddlin&#8217;, if I
can. If I can&#8217;t then, why the next time&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say no more, Take-a-Stitch, I&#8217;ve a whole can
turnin&#8217; sour on me an&#8217; you&#8217;re welcome to a pint
on&#8217;t if you&#8217;ll take it. My respects to the captain, and
here&#8217;s good luck to the Queen of Elbow Lane!&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory swept him a curtsy, flashed a radiant smile upon him and was
tempted to hug him; but she refrained from this, not knowing how such a
caress might be received. Then she thanked and thanked him till he bade
her stop, and with her tin cup in her hand sped homeward again,
crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here am I, grandpa! More milk &#8217;an you can shake a stick at,
with the store-man&#8217;s respeckses an&#8217; all. A hull pint! Think
o&#8217; that! An&#8217; only just a teeny, tiny mite sour. Isn&#8217;t
he the nicest one to give it to us just for nothin&#8217;? An&#8217;
he&#8217;s another sort of Elbow folks, though he&#8217;s off a bit
around the block. Oh, this is just the loveliest world there is!
An&#8217; who&#8217;d want to go to that old &#8216;Snug Harbor&#8217;
an&#8217; leave such dear, dear people, I sh&#8217;d like to know? Not
me nor you, Cap&#8217;n Simon Beck, an&#8217; you know it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory sat down and watched her grandsire make the best dinner he
could upon cold porridge and sour milk, her face radiant with pleasure
that she had been able so well to supply him, and almost forgetting
that horrid, all-gone feeling in her own small stomach. Never mind, a
peanut or so might come her way, if Toni Salvatore, the little Italian
with the long name, should happen to be in a good humor and fling them
to her, for well he knew that of the stock he trusted to her, not a
single goober would be extracted for her personal enjoyment; and this
was why he oftener bestowed upon her a tiny bag of the dainties than
upon any other of his small sales people.</p>

<p>The captain finished his meal and did not distress his darling by
admitting that it was still distasteful, then rose, slung his basket of
frames over his shoulder, took Bo&#8217;sn&#8217;s leading-string, and passed
out to his afternoon&#8217;s peddling and singing. But, though he had
kissed her good-bye, Glory dashed after him, begging still another and
another caress, and feeling the greatest reluctance to letting him go,
yet equally unwilling to have him stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he stays here that man will come and maybe get him,
whether or no; an&#8217; if he goes, the shiny colonel may meet him
outside and take him anyhow. If only he&#8217;d sing alongside o&#8217;
my peddlin&#8217; route! But he won&#8217;t. He never will. He hates to
hear me holler. He says &#8216;little maids shouldn&#8217;t do it&#8217;;
only I have to, to buy my sewin&#8217; things with; an&#8217;&#8213;My,
I clean forgot Posy Jane&#8217;s jacket! I must hurry an&#8217; finish
it, then off to peanuttin&#8217;,&#8221; pondered the child, and
watched the blind man making his way, so surely and safely, around the
corner into the next street, with Bo&#8217;sn walking proudly ahead, what
tail he had pointing skyward and his one good ear pricked forward,
intent and listening.</p>

<p>The old captain in the faded uniform he still wore, and the faithful
little terrier, who guided his sightless master through the dangers of
the city streets with almost a human intelligence were to Goober Glory
the two dearest objects in the world, and for them she would do
anything and everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny how just them few words that shiny man said has changed
our hull feelin&#8217;s &#8217;bout the &#8216;Harbor.&#8217; Only this
mornin&#8217;, &#8217;fore he come, we was a-plannin&#8217; how lovely
&#8217;twas; an&#8217; now&#8211;now I just hate it! I&#8217;m glad
they&#8217;s water &#8217;twixt us an&#8217; that old Staten Island,
an&#8217; I&#8217;m glad we haven&#8217;t ferry money nor
nothin&#8217;,&#8221; cried the little girl, aloud, shaking a small
fist defiantly southward toward the land of her lost dreams. Then,
singing to make herself forget how hungry she was, she hurried into the
littlest house and&#8211;shall it be told?&#8211;caught up her
grandpa&#8217;s plate and licked the crumbs from it, then inverted the
tin cup and let the few drops still left in it trickle slowly down her
throat; and such was Glory&#8217;s dinner.</p>

<p>Afterward she took out needle and thread and heigho! How the neat
stitches fairly flew into place, although to make the small patch fill
the big hole, there had to be a little pucker here and there. Never
mind, a pucker more or less wouldn&#8217;t trouble happy-go-lucky Jane,
who believed little Glory to be the very cleverest child in the whole
world and a perfect marvel of neatness; for, in that particular, she
had been well trained. The old sea captain would allow no dirt
anywhere, being as well able to discover its presence by his touch as
he had once been by sight; and, oddly enough, he was as deft with his
needle as with his knife.</p>

<p>So, the jacket finished, Glory hurried away up the steep stairs to
the great bridge-end, received from the friendly flower-seller
unstinted praise and a ripe banana and felt her last anxiety
vanish.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hull banana just for myself an&#8217; not for pay, dear,
dear Jane? Oh, how good you are! But you listen to me, &#8217;cause I want to
tell you somethin&#8217;. Me an&#8217; grandpa ain&#8217;t never
goin&#8217; to that old &#8216;Snug Harbor,&#8217; never, nohow. We
wouldn&#8217;t be hired to. So there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why, Take-a-Stitch! Why, be I hearin&#8217; or
dreamin&#8217;, I should like to know. Not go there, when I thought you
could scarce wait for the time to come? What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shiny rich man from the avenue where such as him lives and
what owns the ship grandpa used to master, an&#8217; a lot more like it
has so much to do with the &#8216;Harbor&#8217; &#8217;at he can get anybody in it
or out of it just as he pleases. He&#8217;s been twice to see grandpa
an&#8217; made him all solemn an&#8217; poor-feelin&#8217;, like he
ain&#8217;t used to bein&#8217;. Why, he&#8217;s even been cross, truly
cross, if you&#8217;ll believe it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, hardly. Old cap&#8217;n&#8217;s the jolliest soul
ashore, I believe,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if grandpa maybe goes alone, &#8217;cause they
don&#8217;t take little girls, nohow, then that colonel&#8217;d have me
sent off to one o&#8217; them Homeses or &#8217;Sylums for childern that
hasn&#8217;t got no real pas nor mas. Huh, needn&#8217;t tell me.
I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em, time an&#8217; again, walkin&#8217; in
processions, with Sisters of Charity in wide white flappin&#8217; caps
all the time scoldin&#8217; them poor little girls for laughin&#8217;
too loud or gettin&#8217; off the line or somethin&#8217; like that.
An&#8217; them with long-tailed frocks an&#8217; choky kind of aperns
an&#8217; big sunbonnets, lookin&#8217; right at my basket o&#8217;
peanuts an&#8217; never tastin&#8217; a single one. Oh, jest catch me!
I&#8217;ll be a newspaper boy, first, but&#8211;but, Jane dear, do you
s&#8217;pose anything&#8211;any single thing, such as bein&#8217; terrible
hungry, or not gettin&#8217; paid for frames or
singin&#8217;&#8211;could that make my grandpa go and leave
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>For at her own breathless vivid picture of the orphanage children,
as she had seen them, the doubt concerning the captain&#8217;s future
actions returned to torment her afresh.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might be sick, honey, or somethin&#8217; like that, but
not o&#8217; free will. Old Simon Beck&#8217;ll never forsake the
&#8217;light o&#8217; his eyes,&#8217; as I&#8217;ve heard him call you, time
an&#8217; again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret, child,&#8221; continued Posy Jane.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you the &#8216;Queen of Elbow Lane&#8217;? Ain&#8217;t all
of us, round about, fond of you an&#8217; proud of you, same&#8217;s if
you was a real queen, indeed? Who&#8217;d look after Mis&#8217;
McGinty&#8217;s seven babies, when she goes a scrubbin&#8217; the
station floors, if you wasn&#8217;t here? Who&#8217;d help the tailor
with his job when the fits of coughin&#8217; get so bad? &#8217;Twas only a
spell ago he was showin&#8217; me how&#8217;t you&#8217;d sewed in the
linin&#8217; to a coat he was too sick to finish an&#8217; a
praisin&#8217; the stitches beautiful. What&#8217;d the boys do without
you to sew their rags up decent an&#8217; tend to their hurt fingers
an&#8217; share your dinner with &#8217;em when&#8211;when you have one
an&#8217; they don&#8217;t?</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you so masterful like,&#8221; went on the
flower-seller, &#8220;a makin&#8217; everybody do as you say, whether
or no. If it&#8217;s a scrap in a tenement, is my Glory afraid? not a
mite. In she walks, walks she, as bold as bold, an&#8217; lays her hand
on this one&#8217;s shoulder an&#8217; that one&#8217;s arm an&#8217;
makes &#8217;em quit fightin&#8217;. Many&#8217;s the job you&#8217;ve
saved the police, Glory Beck, an&#8217; that very officer yonder was
sayin&#8217; only yesterday how&#8217;t he&#8217;d rather have you on
his beat than another cop, no matter how smart he might be. He says,
says he, &#8216;That little girl can do more to keep the peace in the Lane
&#8217;an the best man on the force,&#8217; says he. &#8216;It&#8217;s prime
wonderful how she manages it.&#8217; An&#8217; I up an&#8217; tells him
nothin&#8217; wonderful &#8217;bout it at all.&#8217; It&#8217;s &#8217;cause
everybody loves you, little Glory, an&#8217; is ashamed not to be just
as good as they know you think they be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret, child,&#8221; Jane went on,
&#8220;Elbow folks won&#8217;t let you go, nor&#8217;ll the cap&#8217;n leave
you, and if bad come to worst them asylums are fine. The Sisters is all
good an&#8217; sweet, givin&#8217; their lives to them &#8217;at needs.
Don&#8217;t you get notions, Glory Beck, an&#8217; judge folks &#8217;fore
you know &#8217;em. If them orphans gets scolded now an&#8217; then it
does &#8217;em good. They ought to be. So&#8217;d you ought, if you
don&#8217;t get off to your peddlin&#8217;. It&#8217;s long past your
time. Here&#8217;s a nickel for the jacket an&#8217; you put it safe by
&#8217;fore you start out. May as well let me pin one o&#8217; these
carnations on you, too. They ain&#8217;t sellin&#8217; so fast
an&#8217; &#8217;twould look purty on your blue frock. Blue an&#8217;
white an&#8217; yeller&#8211;frock an&#8217; flower an&#8217; curly
head&#8211;they compare right good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ere Jane&#8217;s long gossip was ended, her favorite&#8217;s fears
were wholly banished. With a hug for thanks and farewell, Glory was off
and away, and the tired eyes of the toilers in the Lane brightened as
she flitted past their dingy windows, waving a hand to this one and
that and smiling upon all. To put her earnings away in the canvas bag
and catch up her flat, well-mended basket, took but a minute, and,
singing as she went, the busy child sped around to that block where
Antonio had his stand.</p>

<p>That day the trade in goobers had been slack and other of his small
employees had found the peanut-man a trifle cross; but, when
Glory&#8217;s shining head and merry face came into view, his own face
cleared and he gave her a friendly welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fifty-bagger this time, dear Toni! I&#8217;ve got to get a
heap of money after this for grandpa!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alla-right, I fill him,&#8221; returned the vender; and,
having carefully packed the fifty small packets in the shallow basket,
he helped her to poise it on her head, as he had long since taught her
his own countrywomen did. This was a fine thing for the growing child
and gave her a firm erectness not common to young wage-earners. She was
very proud of this accomplishment, as was her teacher, Antonio, and had
more than once outstripped Billy Buttons in a race, still supporting
her burden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sell every bag, little one, and come back to me. I, Antonio
Salvatore have secret, mystery. That will I tell when basket empty.
Secret bring us both to riches, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Crafty Antonio! Well he knew that the little girl&#8217;s curiosity
was great, and had led her into more than one scrape, and that his
promise to impart a secret would make her more eager to sell her stock
than the small money payment she would earn by doing so.</p>

<p>Glory clasped her hands and opened her brown eyes more widely,
entreating, &#8220;Now, Toni, dear Tonio, tell first and sell
afterward. Please, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not so, little one. Sell first, then I tell. If you sell
not&#8213;&#8221; Antonio shrugged his shoulders in a way that meant no
sale, no secret. So, already much belated, Goober Glory&#8211;as she
had now become&#8211;was forced to depart to her task, though she
turned about once or twice to wave farewell to her employer and to
smile upon him, but she meant to make the greatest haste, for, of all
delightful things, a secret was best.</p>

<h2><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>In Elbow Lane</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Pea&#8211;nuts! Cent-a-b-a-a-g!&#8221;</p>

<p>This cry shrilled, almost yelled from the sidewalk upon which she
was descending from her carriage so startled Miss Bonnicastle that she
tripped and fell. In falling, she landed plump in a basket of the nuts
and scattered them broadcast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out there! What you doin&#8217;?&#8221; indignantly
demanded Glory, while a crowd of street urchins gathered to enjoy a
feast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me up, little girl; never mind the nuts,&#8221; begged
the lady, extending her gloved hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind &#8217;em, &#8217;course. They ain&#8217;t
yours!&#8221; retorted the dismayed child, yet seizing the hand with
such vigor that she split the glove and brought its owner to an upright
position with more precision than grace. Then, paying no further heed
to the stranger, she began a boy-to-boy assault upon the purloiners of
her wares; and this, in turn, started such an uproar of shrieks and
gibes and laughter that poor Miss Laura&#8217;s nerves gave way
entirely. Clutching Glory&#8217;s shoulder, she commanded, &#8220;Stop
it, little girl, stop it, right away! You deafen me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The effect was instant. In astonished silence, the lads ceased
struggling and stared at this unknown lady who had dared lay hands on
the little &#8220;Queen of Elbow Lane.&#8221; Wild and rough though
they were, they rarely interfered with the child, and there was more
amazement than anger in Glory&#8217;s own gaze as it swept Miss
Bonnicastle from head to foot. The keen scrutiny made the lady a trifle
uncomfortable and, realizing that she had done an unusual thing, she
hastened to apologize, saying, &#8220;Beg pardon, little girl, I should
not have done that, only the noise was so frightful
and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, that?&#8221; interrupted the peanut vender, with fine
scorn. &#8220;Guess you ain&#8217;t used to Elbow boys. That was
nothin&#8217;. They was only funnin&#8217;, they was. If they&#8217;d
been fightin&#8217; reg&#8217;lar&#8211;my, s&#8217;pose you&#8217;d a fell down
again, s&#8217;pose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wasting no further time upon the stranger, Glory picked up the
basket and examined it, her expression becoming very downcast; and,
seeing this, the boy who had been fiercest in the scramble stepped
closer and asked, &#8220;Is it clean smashed, Glory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clean,&#8221; she answered, sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much&#8217;ll he dock yer?&#8221; asked another lad,
taking the damaged article into his own hands. &#8220;Pshaw,
hadn&#8217;t no handle, nohow. Half the bottom was tore an&#8217;
patched with a rag. One side&#8217;s all lopped over, too. Say, if he
docks yer a cent, he&#8217;s a mean old Dago!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ain&#8217;t he a Dago, Billy Buttons? An&#8217; I put
in that patch myself. I sewed it a hour, with strings out the garbage
boxes, a hull hour. Hi, there! you leave them goobers be!&#8221; cried
the girl, swooping down upon the few youngsters who had returned to
pilfer the scattered nuts and, at once, the two larger boys came to her
aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll help yer, Glory. An&#8217; me an&#8217;
Nick&#8217;ll give ye a nickel a-piece, fer new bags, won&#8217;t we,
Nick?&#8221; comforted Billy. But, receiving no reply from his partner
in the news trade, he looked up to learn the reason. Nick was busily
picking up nuts and replacing them in such bags as remained unbroken
but he wasn&#8217;t eager to part with his money. Nickels were not
plentiful after one&#8217;s food was paid for, and though lodgings cost
nothing, being any odd corner of floor or pavement adjoining the
press-rooms whence he obtained his papers, there were other things he
craved. It would have been easy to promise but there was a code in
Elbow Lane which enforced the keeping of promises. If one broke
one&#8217;s word one&#8217;s head was, also, promptly broken. There was
danger of this even now and there, because Billy&#8217;s foot came
swiftly up to encourage his mate&#8217;s generosity.</p>

<p>However, the kick was dexterously intercepted by Glory; Master
Buttons was thrown upon his back, and Nick escaped both hurt and
promise. With a burst of laughter all three fell to work gathering up
the nuts and the small peddler&#8217;s face was as gay as ever, as she
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, boys, &#8217;tain&#8217;t nigh so bad. Ain&#8217;t
more&#8217;n half of &#8217;em busted. I guess the grocer-man&#8217;ll
trust me to that many&#8211;he&#8217;s real good-natured to-day. His
jumper&#8217;s tore, too, so maybe he&#8217;ll let me work it
out.&#8221; Then, perceiving a peculiar action on the part of the too
helpful Billy, she sternly demanded, &#8220;What you doin&#8217; there,
puttin&#8217; in them shells that&#8217;s been all chewed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! That&#8217;s all right. I jams &#8217;em down in the
bottom. They don&#8217;t show an&#8217; fills up faster&#8217;n th&#8217;
others. Gotter make yer losin&#8217;s good, hain&#8217;t
yer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy Buttons, I have, but I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to
make &#8217;em cheatin&#8217; anybody. What&#8217;d grandpa think or
say to that? Now you can just empty out every single goober shell
you&#8217;ve put in an&#8217; fill up square. I&#8217;ll save them
shells by theirselves, so&#8217;s to have &#8217;em ready next time you
yourself want to buy off me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beautiful justice of this promise so impressed the newsboy that
he turned a somersault, whereby more peanuts were crushed and he earned
a fresh reproof.</p>

<p>Miss Bonnicastle had remained an amused observer of the whole scene,
though the actors in it had apparently forgotten her presence. To
remind them of this, she inquired, &#8220;Children, will you please
tell me how much your peanuts were worth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cent a bag!&#8221; promptly returned Glory, selecting the
best looking packet and holding it toward this possible customer.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of them, I mean. I wish to pay you for all of
them,&#8221; explained the lady, opening her purse.</p>

<p>Too surprised to speak for herself, Nick answered for the vender,
&#8220;They was fifty bags, that&#8217;s fifty cents, an&#8217; five
fer commish. If it&#8217;d been a hunderd, &#8217;twould ha&#8217; been
a dime. Glory, she&#8217;s the best seller Toni Salvatore&#8217;s got,
an&#8217; he often chucks her in a bag fer herself, besides.
Fifty-five&#8217;d be fair, eh, Take-a-Stitch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Glancing at Glory&#8217;s sunny face, Miss Laura did not wonder at
the child&#8217;s success. Almost anybody would buy from her for the
sake of bringing forth one of those flashing smiles, but the girl had
now found her own voice and indignantly cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, parson, if you ain&#8217;t the cheat, I never!
Chargin&#8217; money for goobers what&#8217;s smashed! Think
you&#8217;ll get a lot for yourself, don&#8217;t you? Well, you
won&#8217;t an&#8217; you needn&#8217;t look to, so there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus having rebuked her too zealous champion Glory explained to Miss
Bonnicastle that &#8220;they couldn&#8217;t be more&#8217;n twenty-five
good bags left. They belongs to Antonio Salvatore, the peanut man. I
was goin&#8217; to buy needles an&#8217; thread with part,
needin&#8217; needles most, but no matter. Better luck next time. Do
you really want a bag, lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the tiny packet was extended persuasively, the small peddler
being most anxious to make a sale although her honesty forbade her
accepting payment for goods unsold.</p>

<p>But Miss Laura scarcely saw the paper bag, for she was looking with
so much interest upon the child&#8217;s own face. Such a gay, helpful,
hopeful small face it was! Beneath a tangle of yellow curls, the brown
eyes looked forth so trustfully, and the wide mouth parted in almost
continual laughter over white and well-kept teeth. Then the white
carnation pinned to the faded, but clean, blue frock, gave a touch of
daintiness. Altogether, this seemed a charming little person to be
found in such a locality, where, commonly, the people were poor and
ill-fed, and looked sad rather than glad. The lady&#8217;s surprise was
expressed in her question, &#8220;Little girl, where do you live? How
came you in this neighborhood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;I belong here, &#8217;course. Me an&#8217; grandpa live
in the littlest house in Ne&#8217; York. Me an&#8217; him we live
together, all by our two selves, an&#8217; we have the nicest times
there is. But&#8211;but, did you want a bag?&#8221; she finished,
pleadingly. Time was passing and she was too busy to waste more. She
wondered, too, why anybody so rich as to ride in a carriage should
tarry thus long in Elbow Lane, though, sometimes, people did get astray
and turn into the Lane on their way to cross the big bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, little Glory, as I heard them call you, I meant just
what I said. I wish to buy all your stock as well as pay for a new
basket. Will you please invite your friends to share the feast with
you? I&#8217;m sorry I caused you so much trouble and here, the little
boy suggested fifty-five cents, suppose we make it a dollar? Will that
be wholly satisfactory?&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of Take-a-Stitch was again a study in its perplexity. The
temptation to take the proffered money was great, but a sense of
justice was even greater. After a pause, she said with complete
decision, &#8220;It must be this way; you give me the fifty cents for
Toni Salvatore&#8211;that&#8217;ll be hisn. You take the goobers
an&#8217; give &#8217;em to who you want. I won&#8217;t take no pay for
the basket, &#8217;cause I can mend it again; nor for myself, &#8217;cause I
hain&#8217;t earned it. I hain&#8217;t hollered scarce any to sell such
a lot. That&#8217;s fair. Will I put &#8217;em in your carriage,
lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Oh, dear! No, indeed. Call your mates and divide
among them as you choose. Then&#8211;I wonder why my man doesn&#8217;t
come back. The coachman can&#8217;t leave the horses, and the footman
seems to have lost himself looking for a number it should be easy to
find.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children had gathered about Glory who was now beaming with
delight at the chance to bestow a treat upon her mates as well as enjoy
one herself. Indeed, her hunger made her begin to crack the goobers
with her strong white teeth and to swallow the kernels, skins and all.
But again Miss Bonnicastle touched her shoulder, though this time most
gently, asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;If this is Elbow Lane, and you live in or near it, can you
show me the way to the house of Captain Simon Beck, an old blind
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory gasped and dropped her basket. All the rosy color forsook her
face and fear usurped its gaiety. For a time, she stared at the
handsome old lady in terror, then demanded, brokenly,
&#8220;Be&#8211;you&#8211;from&#8211;&#8216;Snug Harbor&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now the stranger&#8217;s turn to stare. Wondering why the
child had asked such a question and seemed so startled, she answered,
&#8220;In a way, both yes and no. I am interested in &#8216;Snug
Harbor,&#8217; and have come to find an old, blind sea captain whom my
brother employed, in order to take him, myself, to that comfortable
home. Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Glory fled, but she turned once to shake a warning fist toward
Nick and Billy, who instantly understood her silent message and glared
defiantly upon the lady who had just given them an unexpected
feast.</p>

<h2><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>Beside Old Trinity</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is the matter? Why did she run away?&#8221; asked
the astonished stranger.</p>

<p>Billy giggled and punched Nick who was now apportioning the peanuts
among the children he had whistled to his side, but neither lad
replied.</p>

<p>This vexed Miss Bonnicastle who had come to the Lane in small hope
of influencing the old captain to do as her brother had wished him to
do and to remove, at once, to the comfortable &#8220;Harbor&#8221;
across the bay. She had undertaken the task at her brother&#8217;s
request; and also at his desire, had driven thither in the carriage, in
order to carry the blind man away with her, without the difficulty of
getting him in and out of street cars and ferry boat. It would greatly
simplify matters if he would just step into the vehicle at his own
humble door and step out of it again at the entrance to his new
home.</p>

<p>But the Lane had proved even narrower and dirtier than she had
expected. She was afraid that having once driven into it the coachman
would not be able to drive out again, and the odors of river and
market, which the blind seaman found so delightful, made her ill. She
had deprived herself of her accustomed afternoon nap; she had sprained
her ankle in falling; her footman had been gone much longer than she
expected, searching for the captain&#8217;s house; and though she had
been amused by the little scene among the alley children which had been
abruptly ended by Glory&#8217;s flight, she was now extremely anxious
to finish her errand and be gone.</p>

<p>In order to rest her aching ankle, she stepped back into the
carriage and from thence called to Billy, at the same time holding up
to view a quarter dollar.</p>

<p>Master Buttons did not hesitate. He was glad that Nick happened to
be looking another way and did not see the shining coin which he meant
to have for himself, if he could get it without disloyalty to Glory.
Hurrying forward, he pulled off his ragged cap and inquired, &#8220;Did
you want me, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, little boy. What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else? Your surname?&#8221; continued the questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? What? Oh&#8211;I guess &#8216;Buttons,&#8217; &#8217;cause onct I was
a messenger boy. That&#8217;s what gimme these clo&#8217;es, but I
quit.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to fear there was no money in this job, after all, for the
hand which had displayed the silver piece now rested in the
lady&#8217;s lap; and, watching the peanut feasters, he felt himself
defrauded of his own rightful share. He stood first upon one bare foot
then upon the other, and, with affectation of great haste, pulled a
damaged little watch from his blouse and examined it critically. The
watch had been found in a refuse heap, and even in its best days had
been incapable of keeping time, yet its possession by Billy Buttons
made him the envy of his mates.</p>

<p>He did not see the amused smile with which the lady regarded him,
and though disappointed by her next question it was, after all, the
very one he had anticipated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy Buttons, will you earn a quarter by showing me the way
to where Captain Beck lives? that is, if you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I knows it all right, but I can&#8217;t show
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t? Why not? Is it too far?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought he had never heard anybody ask so many questions in so
short a time and was on the point of saying so, impertinently, yet
found it not worth while. Instead, he remarked, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
sayin&#8217; if it&#8217;s fur er near, but I guess I better be
goin&#8217; down to th&#8217; office now an&#8217; see if they&#8217;s
a extry out. Might be a fire, er murder, er somethin&#8217;
doin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that courtesy which even the gamins of the streets
unconsciously acquire from their betters, Billy pulled off his cap
again and moved away. But he was not to escape so easily. Miss
Laura&#8217;s hand clasped his soiled sleeve and forth came another
question, &#8220;Billy, is that little girl your sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey? No such luck fer Buttons. She ain&#8217;t nobody&#8217;s
sister, she ain&#8217;t. She just belongs to the hull Lane, Glory does.
Huh! Take-a-Stitch my sister? Wished she was. She&#8217;s only
cap&#8217;n&#8213; Shucks!&#8221; Having so nearly betrayed himself, Billy
broke from the restraining hand and disappeared.</p>

<p>Miss Bonnicastle sighed and leaned back upon her cushions, feeling
that something evil must have befallen her faithful footman to keep him
so long away, and almost deciding to give up this apparently hopeless
quest. Then she discovered that Nick had drawn near. Possibly, he would
act as her guide, even if his mate had refused. She again held up the
quarter and beckoned the lad.</p>

<p>He responded promptly, his eyes glittering with greed as they fixed
upon the coin&#8211;not to be removed from it till it was in his own
possession, no matter how many questions were asked. These began at
once, in a crisp, imperative tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little boy, tell me your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nick, the parson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed? Nick Parsons, I suppose. Is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m. I&#8217;m Nicky Dodd. I got a father. He&#8217;s
Dodd. So be I, &#8217;course. But the fellers stuck it onto me
&#8217;cause&#8211;&#8217;cause onct I went to a Sunday-school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go now, Nick Dodd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeedy! Ketch me!&#8221; laughed the boy, watching the
gleam of the money his questioner held so lightly between her gloved
fingers. What if she should drop it! If some other child should see it
fall and seize it before he could! &#8220;Was&#8211;was you
a-wantin&#8217; somethin&#8217; of me, lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was. Will you show me the way to Captain Beck&#8217;s
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Nick loved Glory as well as Billy did and he had as fully
understood from her warning gesture that he was to give this stranger
no information concerning her or her grandfather, but, alas! he also
loved money, and he so rarely had it. Just then, too, the
&#8220;Biggest Show On Earth&#8221; was up at Madison Square Garden
and, if Nick had not remembered that enticing circus, he might not have
betrayed his friend. Yet those wonderful trained animals&#8213;Ah!</p>

<p>&#8220;Fer that quarter? Ye-es, ma&#8217;am,
I&#8211;I&#8211;will,&#8221; stammered the lad.</p>

<p>So Miss Laura again left her carriage and walked the narrow, dirty
length of the Lane, past the sharp bend which gave it its name of
&#8220;Elbow,&#8221; far down among the warehouses and wharves crowding
the approach to the bridge. As she walked, she still asked questions
and found that all the dwellers in the Lane were better known by their
employments than their real names, how that Glory&#8217;s deftness with
a needle had made her &#8220;Take-a-Stitch,&#8221; and anybody might
guess why Jane was called &#8220;Posy&#8221; or Captain Beck had become
the &#8220;Singer.&#8221; Besides, she discovered that this ragged
newsboy was as fond and proud of his &#8220;Lane&#8221; as she was of
her avenue, and that if she had any pity to bestow, she needn&#8217;t
waste it on him or his mates and that&#8213;</p>

<p>&#8220;There &#8217;tis! The littlest house in Ne&#8217;
York,&#8221; concluded Nick, proudly pointing forward, seizing the coin
she held so carelessly, and vanishing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! have I become a scarecrow that all these children
desert me so suddenly!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Laura, looking helplessly
about and lifting her skirts the higher to avoid the dirty suds which
somebody was emptying into the gutter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am?&#8221; asked the woman with the tub, dropping it
and with arms akimbo staring amazedly at the stranger. How had such a
fine madam come there? &#8220;Was you a-lookin&#8217; for somebody,
ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Laura turned her sweet old face toward the other,
Meg-Laundress, and answered, &#8220;Yes, for one, Captain Simon Beck. A
boy told me this tiny place was where he lives&#8211;though it
doesn&#8217;t seem possible any one could really live in so small a
room&#8211;and it&#8217;s empty now, anyway. Do you know where he
is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Off a-singin&#8217; likely. He mostly is, this time o&#8217;
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry. I have come&#8213;&#8221; Miss
Bonnicastle checked herself, unwilling to disclose to this rough
stranger affairs in which she had no concern. &#8220;I was told he had
a grandchild living with him. Is she anywhere about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory? She&#8217;s off peddlin&#8217; her goobers, I s&#8217;pose.
I can give &#8217;em any word that&#8217;s left,&#8221; said Meg, with
friendly interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory? Is her name Glory? Is it she I saw with a basket of
peanuts, a yellow haired, bright-faced little girl, in a blue
frock?&#8221; cried the lady, eagerly, and recalling the child&#8217;s
inquiry about &#8220;Snug Harbor&#8221; felt that she should have
guessed as much even then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. The purtiest little creatur&#8217; goin&#8217;; or, if
not so purty, so good-natured an&#8217; lovin&#8217;. Why, she&#8217;s
all the sunlight we gets in the Lane, Glory is, an&#8217;, havin&#8217;
her, some on us don&#8217;t &#8217;pear to need no more. Makes all on us do
her say-so but always fer our own betterment. In an&#8217; out, up
an&#8217; down, lendin&#8217; a hand or settin&#8217; a stitch or
tendin&#8217; a baby, all in the day&#8217;s work, an&#8217;
queenin&#8217; it over the hull lot, that&#8217;s our &#8216;Goober
Glory,&#8217; bless her! And evil to anybody would harm the child, say
I! Though who&#8217;d do ill to her? Is&#8217;t a bit of word
you&#8217;d be after leavin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; said Meg, with
both kindness and curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. If you see either of them, will you say that Miss
Bonnicastle, Colonel Bonnicastle&#8217;s sister, will be here again in
the morning, unless it storms, upon important business? Ask them to
wait here for me, please. I should not like to make a second useless
trip. Good-afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the gentlewoman turned and made her way back along the alley
toward her distant carriage, which could come no nearer to her because
the Lane was so narrow, Meg watched and admired her, reflecting with
some pride:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the real stuff, that old lady is. Treated me
polite &#8217;s if I was the same sort she is. I wonder what&#8217;s
doin&#8217; &#8217;twixt her an&#8217; the Becks? Well, I&#8217;ll find out
afore I sleep, or my name ain&#8217;t Meg-Laundress, an&#8217; I say
it. Guess Jane&#8217;ll open her eyes when I up an&#8217; tells her how
one them grand folks she sees crossin&#8217; the bridge so constant has
got astray in the Lane an&#8217; come a visitin&#8217;, actilly a
visitin&#8217;, one our own folks. But then, I always knowed, we
Elbowers was a touch above some, an&#8217; now she&#8217;ll know it,
too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish the cap&#8217;n would come in,&#8221; continued Meg.
&#8220;But &#8217;twill be a long spell yet afore he does. An&#8217;,
my land! I must sure remind him to put on his other shirt in the
mornin&#8217;. He don&#8217;t never get no sile on him, the cap&#8217;n
don&#8217;t, yet when grand carriage folks comes a callin&#8217;,
it&#8217;s a time for the best or nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>By a roundabout way, Glory had hurried, breathlessly, to her tiny
home, fearing that by some mischance grandpa might have returned to it,
and that this fresh advocate of the &#8220;Harbor&#8221; would find him
there. She was such a pretty old lady, she had such a different manner
from that of the Lane women, she might persuade the gallant old captain
to accompany her to the asylum, whether or no. If he were at home,
Glory meant to coax him elsewhere; or, if he would not go, then she
would remain and use her own influence against that of this dangerous
stranger.</p>

<p>One glance showed her that all was yet safe. The tiny room was empty
and neither &#8220;Grandpa!&#8221; nor &#8220;Bo&#8217;sn!&#8221; answered to
her call.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t got no goobers to sell now an&#8217; them boys
won&#8217;t show her a step of the way an&#8217; she couldn&#8217;t get
here so quick all herself without bein&#8217; showed so I may as well
rest a minute,&#8221; said Glory to herself, and sat down on the narrow
threshold to get cool and to decide upon what she should do.</p>

<p>But she could not sit still. A terrible feeling that these strangers
were determined to separate her from her grandfather made her too
restless. It was natural, she thought, that they should wish to do him
a kindness, such as providing him with a fine home for life. He was a
grown-up man and a very clever one, while she was only a little girl,
of no account whatever. They didn&#8217;t care about her, &#8217;course, but
him&#8213;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go find him! I must keep him away, clear, clear away
from the Lane till it gets as dark as dark. Then we can come home
an&#8217; sleep. Such as them don&#8217;t come here o&#8217;
nights,&#8221; cried Glory, springing up. &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;m
glad grandpa is blind. If he went right close by them two he
couldn&#8217;t see &#8217;em, an&#8217; she, she, anyway, don&#8217;t
know him. I wonder where best to look first. I s&#8217;pose Broadway, &#8217;cause
that&#8217;s where he gets the most money. They&#8217;s such a heap of
folks on that wide street an&#8217; it&#8217;s so nice to look
at.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having decided her route, Glory was off and away. She dared not
think about Toni Salvatore and his anger. She did not see how she would
ever be able to repay him for his loss and she could remember nothing
at all about the money Miss Bonnicastle had offered her. If Billy or
Nick had taken it, they would give it to her, of course; but if
not&#8211;well, that was a small matter compared to the spiriting away
of her grandfather and she must find him and hold him fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa don&#8217;t go above the City Hall, &#8217;cause Bo&#8217;sn
don&#8217;t know the way so well. Up fur&#8217;s there an&#8217; down
to Trinity; that&#8217;s the &#8216;tack he sails&#8217; an&#8217; there
I&#8217;ll seek him. I wish one them boys was here to help me look,
though if he was a-singin&#8217; I shouldn&#8217;t need
nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>So thinking and peering anxiously into the midst of every crowd and
listening with keen intentness, the little girl threaded her way to the
northern limit of the captain&#8217;s accustomed &#8220;beat.&#8221;
But there was no sign nor sound of him upon the eastern side of the
thoroughfare, and, crossing to the more crowded western side, she crept
southward, step by step, scanning every face she passed and looking
into every doorway, for in such places the blind singer sometimes took
his station, to avoid the jostling of the passers-by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll have to go &#8217;way down to the Battery, &#8217;cause
he does, often. Though &#8217;seems he couldn&#8217;t hardly got there
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Glory was but a little girl, and, in watching the shifting
scenes of the busy street, she soon forgot her first anxiety and became
absorbed in what was around her. And when she had walked as far
southward as old Trinity, there were the lovely chimes ringing and, as
always, a mighty crowd had paused to listen to them. Glory loved the
chimes, and so did grandpa; and it was their habit on every festival
when they were to be rung to come and hear them. Always the child was
so moved by these exquisite peals that when they ceased she felt as if
she had been in another world, and it was so now. To hear every tone
better, she had clasped her hands and closed her eyes and uplifted her
rapt face; and so standing upon the very curb, she was rudely roused by
a commotion in the crowd about her.</p>

<p>There was the tramping of horses&#8217; feet, the shouts of the
police, the &#8220;Ahs!&#8221; and &#8220;Ohs!&#8221; of pity which
betokened some accident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out the way, child! You&#8217;ll be crushed in this jam! Keep
back there, people! Keep back!&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory made herself as small as she could and shrank aside. Then
curiosity sent her forward again to see and listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;An old man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if he were blind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back those horses! Make way&#8211;the ambulance&#8211;make
way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All over with that poor fellow! A pity, a pity!&#8221;</p>

<p>These exclamations of the onlookers and the orders of the policemen
mingled in one harsh clamor, yet leaving distinct upon Glory&#8217;s
hearing the words, &#8220;An old blind man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how sorry grandpa will be to know that!&#8221; thought
the child, and, with eagerness to learn every detail of the sad affair,
stooped and wormed her way beneath elbows and between legs till she had
come to the very roadbed down which an ambulance was dashing at highest
speed, its clanging bell warning everything from its path. Right before
the curb where she stood it paused, uniformed men sprang to the
pavement and, with haste that was still reverent and tender, laid the
injured man upon the stretcher; then off and away again, and the little
girl had caught but the faintest glimpse of a gray head and faded blue
garments, yet thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;Might be another old captain, it might. Won&#8217;t grandpa
be sorry&#8211;if I tell him. Maybe I shan&#8217;t, though I must hurry
up an&#8217; find him, &#8217;cause seein&#8217; that makes me feel dreadful
lonesome, &#8217;seems if. Oh! I do wish nobody ever need get hurted or
terrible poor, or anything not nice! And&#8211;oh, oh, there&#8217;s
that very lady I run away from, what come to the Lane! Drivin&#8217;
down in her very carriage and if&#8213;She mustn&#8217;t see me! She
must not&#8211;&#8217;less she&#8217;s got him in there with her a&#8217;ready!
What if!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Bonnicastle&#8217;s laudau was, indeed, being carefully driven
through the jam of wagons which had stopped to give the ambulance room
and she was anxiously watching the inch-by-inch progress of her own
conveyance. Yet with an expression of far keener anxiety, Goober Glory
recklessly darted into the very tangle of wheels and animals, crying
aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s goin&#8217; straight down toward that
&#8216;Harbor&#8217; ferry! Like&#8217;s not she&#8217;s heard him
singin&#8217; somewhere an&#8217; coaxed him to get in there with her.
He might be th&#8217; other side&#8211;where I can&#8217;t
see&#8211;an&#8217; I must find out&#8211;I must! For&#8213;<i>What
if!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She reached the carriage steps, sprang upon them, by one glance
satisfying herself that the lady was alone, turned to retreat, but felt
herself falling.</p>

<h2><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Desolate Awakening</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;You little dunce! Don&#8217;t you know better than do
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>An indignant shake accompanied these words, with which the big
policeman set Glory down upon the sidewalk after having rescued her
from imminent death.</p>

<p>In the instant of her slipping from the carriage step, the child had
realized her own peril and would most certainly have been trampled
under the crowding, iron-shod hoofs, had not the officer been on the
very spot, trying to prevent accidents, and to keep clear from each
other the two lines of vehicles, one moving north, the other south.</p>

<p>Glory was so rejoiced to find herself free and unhurt that she
minded neither the shaking nor the term &#8220;dunce,&#8221; but
instantly caught the rescuer&#8217;s hand and kissed it rapturously,
crying, &#8220;Oh, thank you, thank you! Grandpa would have felt so bad
if I&#8217;d been hurt like that poor blind man. Oh, I wish I could do
somethin&#8217; for you, you dear, splendid p&#8217;liceman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can. You can remember that a young one&#8217;s
place is at home, not in the middle of the street. There, that will do.
Be off with you and never cut up such a caper again, long&#8217;s you
live. It would have been &#8216;all day&#8217; with you, if I hadn&#8217;t
been just where I was, and two accidents within five minutes is
more&#8217;n I bargain for. Be off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Releasing his hand, he returned to his task among the wagons but
carried with him a pleasant memory of a smile that was so grateful and
so gay; while Glory, subdued by what she had gone through, slowly
resumed her search for her missing grandfather. Away down to the South
ferry she paced, looking and listening everywhere. Then back again on
the other side of the long street till she had reached the point
nearest to Elbow Lane and still no sign of a blue-coated old man or a
little dog with a stub of a tail and but one good ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s nigh night now, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll be
comin&#8217; home. Most the folks what gives him pennies or buys his
frames has left Broadway so I might as well go myself. Come to think, I
guess I better not tell grandpa &#8217;bout that poor hurted man. Might
make him &#8217;fraid to go round himself with nobody &#8217;cept Bo&#8217;sn to take
care of him an&#8217; him a dog. An&#8217; oh, dear! Whatever shall I
do for sewin&#8217; things, now I didn&#8217;t get no goober money?
Well, anyway, there&#8217;s that nickel o&#8217; Jane&#8217;s will buy
a chop for his supper an&#8217; I best hurry get it ready. He&#8217;s
always so terrible hungry when he comes off his &#8216;beat.&#8217; An&#8217;
me&#8211;why, I b&#8217;lieve I hain&#8217;t eat a thing to-day, save my
breakfast porridge an&#8217; Jane&#8217;s banana, an&#8217; two er
three goobers. Never mind, likely grandpa&#8217;ll bring in
somethin&#8217; an&#8217; I can eat to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back to the littlest house she ran, singing to forget her appetite,
and whisked out the key of the tiny door from its hiding-place beneath
the worn threshold, yet wondering a little that grandpa should not
already have arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, I&#8217;ll have everything done &#8217;fore. Then when
he does get here all he&#8217;ll have to do&#8217;ll be to eat
an&#8217; go to bed,&#8221; she said to herself. Glory was such a
little chatterbox that when she had no other listener she made one of
herself.</p>

<p>The corner-grocer was just taking his own supper of bread and
herrings on the rear end of his small counter when she entered,
demanding, &#8220;The very best an&#8217; biggest chop you&#8217;ve got
for a nickel, Mister Grocer; or if you could make it a four-center
an&#8217; leave me a cent&#8217;s worth o&#8217; bread to go along it,
&#8217;t would be tastier for grandpa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough, queeny, sure enough. &#8217;Pears like I brought
myself fortune when I give you that pint o&#8217; milk. I&#8217;ve had
a reg&#8217;lar string o&#8217; customers sence, I have. An&#8217; here, what
you lookin&#8217; so sharp at that one chop for? Didn&#8217;t you know
I was goin&#8217; to make it two, an&#8217; loaf
accordin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory swallowed fast. This was almost too tempting for resistance,
but she had been trained to a horror of debt and had resolved upon that
slight one, earlier in the day, only because she could not see her
grandfather distressed. Her own distress&#8213;Huh! That was an
indifferent matter.</p>

<p>The corner groceries of the poor are also their meat markets,
bakeries, and dairies, and there was so much in the crowded little shop
that was alluring that the child forced herself to look diligently out
of the door into the alley lest she should be untrue to her training.
In a brief time the shopman called, &#8220;All ready, Take-a-Stitch!
Here&#8217;s your parcel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory faced about and gasped. That was such a very big parcel toward
which he pointed that she felt he had made a mistake and so reminded
him, &#8220;Guess that ain&#8217;t mine, that ain&#8217;t. One chop
an&#8217; a small roll &#8217;twas. That must be Mis&#8217;
Dodd&#8217;s, &#8217;cause she&#8217;s got nine mouths to feed, savin&#8217;
Nick&#8217;s &#8217;at he feeds himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so, neighbor. It&#8217;s yourn. The hull o&#8217; it.
They&#8217;s only a loaf, a trifle stale&#8211;one them three-centers,
kind of mouldy on the corners where&#8217;t can be cut
off&#8211;an&#8217; two the finest chops you ever set your little white
teeth into. They&#8217;re all yourn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grocer enjoyed doing this kindness as heartily as she enjoyed
receiving it, although he was so thrifty that he made his own meal from
equally stale bread and some unsalable dried fish. But, after a
momentary rapture at the prospect of such delicious food, Glory&#8217;s
too active conscience interfered, making her say, with a regret almost
beyond expression, &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t, I mustn&#8217;t. Grandpa
wouldn&#8217;t like it, &#8217;cause he says &#8216;always pay&#8217;s you go or
else don&#8217;t go,&#8217; an&#8217; that nickel&#8217;s all
I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, &#8217;tisn&#8217;t. Not by a reckonin&#8217;. You&#8217;ve got
the nimblest pair o&#8217; hands I know an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got the
shabbiest coat. I&#8217;m fair ashamed to wear it to market, yet I
ain&#8217;t a man &#8217;shamed of trifles. If you&#8217;ll put them hands of
yourn and that coat o&#8217; mine together, I&#8217;d be like to credit
you a quarter, an&#8217; you find the patches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A quarter! A hull, endurin&#8217; quarter of a dollar! You
darlin&#8217; old grocer-man. &#8217;Course I will, only I&#8211;I&#8217;m
nigh out o&#8217; thread, but I&#8217;ve got a power o&#8217; patches.
I&#8217;ve picked &#8217;em out the ash-boxes an&#8217; washed
&#8217;em beautiful. An&#8217; they&#8217;re hung right on our own
ceiling in the cutest little bundle ever was&#8211;an&#8217;&#8211;I
love you, I love you; Give me the coat, quick, right now, so&#8217;s I
can run an&#8217; patch it, an&#8217; you see if I don&#8217;t do the
best job ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of thread, be you? Well, here, take this fine spool
o&#8217; black linen an&#8217; a needle to fit. A workman has to have
his tools, don&#8217;t he? I couldn&#8217;t keep store if I
didn&#8217;t have things to sell, could I? Now, be off with you,
an&#8217; my good word to the cap&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>

<p>There wasn&#8217;t a happier child in all the great city than little
Take-a-Stitch as she fairly flew homeward to prepare the most delicious
supper there had been in the littlest house for many a day. Down came
the tiny gas stove from its shelf, out popped a small frying pan from
some hidden cubby and into it went a dash of salt and the two big
chops. Oh, how delightful was their odor, and how Glory&#8217;s mouth
did water at thought of tasting! But that was not to be till grandpa
came. She hoped that would be at once, before they cooled; for the
burning of gas, their only fuel, was managed with strictest economy. It
would seem a wasteful sin to light the stove again to reheat the chops,
as she would have to do if the captain was not on hand soon.</p>

<p>Alas! they were cooked to the utmost limit of that brown crispness
which the seaman liked, and poor Glory had turned faint at the delayed
enjoyment of her own supper, when she felt she must turn out the blaze
or ruin all. Covering the pan to keep its contents hot as long as might
be, she sat down on the threshold to wait; and, presently, was
asleep.</p>

<p>It had grown quite dark before the touch of a cold wet nose upon the
palm of her hand aroused her, and there was Bo&#8217;sn, rubbing his side
against her knee and uttering a dismal sort of sound that was neither
bark nor howl, but a cross between both and full of painful
meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bo&#8217;sn! You? Then grandpa&#8211;oh, grandpa, darlin&#8217;,
darlin&#8217;, why didn&#8217;t you wake me? I&#8217;ve got the nicest
supper&#8213;Smell?&#8221;</p>

<p>With that she sprang up and darted within, over the few feet of
space there was, but nobody was in sight; then out again, to call the
captain from some spot where he had doubtless paused to exchange a bit
of neighborly gossip. To him the night was the same as the day, the
child remembered, and though it wasn&#8217;t often he overstayed his
regular hour, or forgot his meal-time, he might have done so now. Oh,
yes, he might easily have done so, she assured herself. But why should
Bo&#8217;sn forsake his master and come home alone? He had never done that
before, never. And why, oh, why, did he make that strange wailing
noise? He frightened her and must stop it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet, boy, quiet!&#8221; she ordered, clasping the
animal&#8217;s head so that he was forced to look up into her face.
&#8220;Quiet, and tell me&#8211;where is grandpa? Where did you leave
grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, he could not answer, save by ceasing to whine and by
gazing at her with his loving brown eyes as if they must tell for him
that which he had seen.</p>

<p>Then, seized by an overwhelming anxiety, which she would not permit
herself to put into a definite fear, she shook the dog impatiently and
started down the Lane. It was full of shadows now, which the one gas
street lamp deepened rather than dispersed, and she did not see a woman
approaching until she had run against her. Then she looked up and
exclaimed, &#8220;Oh, Posy Jane! You just gettin&#8217; home? Have you
seen my grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cap&#8217;n? Bless you, child, how should I, seein&#8217; he
don&#8217;t sing on the bridge. Ain&#8217;t he come in yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and oh, Jane, dear Jane, I&#8217;m afraid somethin&#8217;
&#8217;s happened to him. He never, never stayed away so late before
an&#8217; Bo&#8217;sn came alone. What s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>

<p>The flower-seller had slipped an arm about the child&#8217;s
shoulders and felt them trembling, and though an instant alarm had
filled her own heart, she made light of the matter to give her favorite
comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I s&#8217;pose? Well, then, I s&#8217;pose he&#8217;s
stayin&#8217; away lest them rich folks what runs the &#8216;Harbor&#8217;
comes again an&#8217; catches him unbeknownst. Don&#8217;t you go fret,
honey. Had your supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Jane, an&#8217; it&#8217;s such a splendid one. That
lovely grocer man&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; interrupted the woman, with a derisive shrug of
her shoulders. &#8220;You&#8217;re the beatin&#8217;est child for
seein&#8217; handsomeness where &#8217;tain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I &#8217;member you don&#8217;t like him much, &#8217;cause onct he
give short measure o&#8217; flour, or somethin&#8217;, but he is good
an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t mean purty, an&#8217; just listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane did listen intently to the story of the grocer&#8217;s unusual
generosity, and she hearkened, also, for the sound of a familiar,
hesitating footstep and the thump of a heavy cane, such as would reveal
the captain&#8217;s approach long before he might be seen, but the Lane
was very silent. It was later than Glory suspected and almost all the
toilers were in their beds. It was late, even for the flower-seller,
who had been up-town to visit an ailing friend and had tarried there
for supper.</p>

<p>Jane had always felt it dangerous for a blind man, like the old
seaman, to go about the city, attended only by a dog, but she knew,
too, that necessity has no choice. The Becks must live and only by
their united industry had they been able to keep even their tiny roof
over their heads thus far. If harm had come to him&#8211;what would
become of Glory? Well, time enough to think of that when the harm had
really happened. The present fact was that the little girl was
famishing with hunger yet had a fine supper awaiting her. She must be
made to eat it without further delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, deary, we&#8217;ll step along an&#8217; you eat your
own chop, savin&#8217; hisn till he sees fit to come get it. A man &#8217;at
has sailed the ocean hitherty-yender, like Cap&#8217;n Simon Beck has,
ain&#8217;t likely to get lost in the town where he was born an&#8217;
raised. Reckon some them other old crony cap&#8217;ns o&#8217; hisn has met
an&#8217; invited him to eat along o&#8217; them. That Cap&#8217;n Gray,
maybe, or somebody. First you know, we&#8217;ll hear him stumpin&#8217;
down the Lane, singin&#8217; &#8216;A life on the ocean wa-a-ave,&#8217; fit
to rouse the entire neighborhood. You eat your supper an&#8217; go to
bed, where children ought to be long &#8217;fore this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Posy Jane&#8217;s tone was so confident and cheerful that Glory
forgot her anxiety and remembered only that chop which was awaiting
her. The pair hurried back to the littlest house which the
flower-seller seemed entirely to fill with her big person, but she
managed to get about sufficiently to relight the little stove, place
Glory in her own farthest corner, and afterward watch the child enjoy
her greatly needed food.</p>

<p>When Glory had finished, she grew still more happy, for physical
comfort was added to that of her friend&#8217;s words; nor did
Jane&#8217;s kindness stop there. She herself carefully covered the pan
with the captain&#8217;s portion in it, and bade Glory undress and
climb into her little hammock that swung from the side of the room
opposite the seaman&#8217;s. This she also let down and put into it the
pillow and blanket.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he can go right straight to sleep himself without
botherin&#8217; you, honey. Come, Bo&#8217;sn, you&#8217;ve polished that
bone till it shines an&#8217; you quit. Lie right down on the
door-sill, doggie, an&#8217; watch &#8217;at nobody takes a thing out the
place, though I don&#8217;t know who would, that belongs to the Lane,
sure enough. But a stranger might happen by an&#8217; see
somethin&#8217; temptin&#8217; &#8217;mongst the cap&#8217;n&#8217;s belongings.
An&#8217; so good-night to you, little Take-a-Stitch, an&#8217;
pleasant dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Posy Jane, having done all she could for the child she loved
betook herself to her room in Meg-Laundress&#8217;s small tenement,
though she would gladly have watched in the littlest house for the
return of its master, a return which she continually felt was more and
more doubtful. And Glory slept peacefully the whole night through. Nor
did Bo&#8217;sn&#8217;s own uneasy slumbers disturb her once. Not till it was
broad daylight and much later than her accustomed hour for waking, did
she open her eyes and glance across to that other hammock where should
have rested a dear gray head.</p>

<p>It was still empty, and the fact banished all her drowsiness. With a
bound she was on her feet and at the door, looking out, all up and down
the Lane. Alas! He was nowhere in sight and, turning back into the tiny
room, she saw his supper still untasted in the pan where Jane had left
it. Then with a terrible conviction, which turned her faint, she
dropped down on the floor beside Bo&#8217;sn, who was dolefully whining
again, and hugged him to her breast, crying bitterly, &#8220;They have
got him! They have got him! He&#8217;ll never come again!&#8221;</p>

<h2><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>The Beginning of the Search</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;O Bo&#8217;sn, Bo&#8217;sn! Where did you leave him? You never left him
before&#8211;never, not once! Oh, if you could only talk!&#8221; cried
poor Glory, at last lifting her head and releasing the dog whom she had
hugged till he choked.</p>

<p>His brown eyes looked back into her own pleading ones as if he, too,
longed for the gift of speech and he licked her cheek as if he would
comfort her. Then he threw back his own head, howled dismally, and
dejectedly curled himself down beneath the captain&#8217;s hammock.</p>

<p>Little Take-a-Stitch pondered a moment what she had best do in order
to find her grandfather and, having decided, made haste to dress. The
cold water from the spigot in the corner refreshed her and seemed to
clear her thoughts, but she did not stop to eat anything, though she
offered a crust of the dry loaf to the dog. He, also, refused the food
and the little girl understood why. Patting him on the head she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;We both of us can&#8217;t eat till he comes, can we, Bo&#8217;sn
dear? Well, smart doggie, put on your sharpest smeller an&#8217; help
to track him whichever way he went. You smell an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
look, an&#8217; &#8217;twixt us we&#8217;ll hunt him quick&#8217;s-a-wink.
Goin&#8217; to find grandpa, Bo&#8217;sn Beck! Come along an&#8217; find
grandpa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Up sprang the terrier, all his dejection gone, and leaped and barked
as joyfully as if he fully understood what she had said. Then, waiting
just long enough to lock the tiny door and hide the key in its
accustomed place, so that if the captain came home before she did he
could let himself in, she started down the Lane, running at highest
speed with Bo&#8217;sn keeping pace. So running, she passed the basement
window where Meg-Laundress was rubbing away at her tub full of clothes
and tossed that good woman a merry kiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess the old cap&#8217;n&#8217;s back, &#8217;less Glory never &#8217;d
look that gay,&#8221; thought Meg, and promptly reported her thought to
Posy Jane who was just setting out for her day&#8217;s business. She
was already over-late and was glad to accept Meg&#8217;s statement as
fact and thus save the time it would have taken to visit the littlest
house and learn there how matters really stood. It thus happened that
neither of Glory&#8217;s best friends knew the truth of the case nor
that the child had set off on a hopeless quest, without food or money
or anything save her own strong love and will to help her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to find grandpa, Bo&#8217;sn, an&#8217;
we don&#8217;t mind a thing else. Don&#8217;t take so very long to get
to that old &#8216;Harbor,&#8217; an&#8217; maybe he might have a bite
o&#8217; somethin&#8217; saved up &#8217;at he could give us, though we
don&#8217;t neither of us want to eat &#8217;fore we get him back, do we,
doggie?&#8221; cried the child as they sped along and trying not to
notice that empty feeling in her stomach.</p>

<p>But they had gone no further than the end of the Lane before they
collided with Nick, the parson, just entering it. He had finished his
morning&#8217;s sale of papers and was feeling hungry for his own
breakfast and, as Take-a-Stitch ran against him, demanded rather
angrily, &#8220;What you mean, Goober Glory, knockin&#8217; a feller
down that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Nick! Have you seen grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen the cap&#8217;n? How should I? Ain&#8217;t this his time
o&#8217; workin&#8217; on his frames?&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory swiftly told her trouble and Nick&#8217;s face clouded in
sympathy. Finally he suggested, &#8220;They was a old blind feller got
run over on Broadway yest&#8217;day. Likely &#8217;twas him an&#8217;
that&#8217;s why. &#8217;Twas in the paper all right, &#8217;cause I heard a man
say how&#8217;t somethin&#8217; must be done to stop such accidentses.
Didn&#8217;t hear no name but, &#8217;course, &#8217;twas the cap&#8217;n. Posy
Jane always thought he&#8217;d get killed, runnin&#8217; round loose,
like he did, without nobody but a dog takin&#8217; care.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory had clutched Nick&#8217;s shoulder and was now shaking him
with what little strength seemed left to her after hearing his dreadful
words. As soon as she could recover from that queer feeling in her
throat, and was able to speak, she indignantly denied the possibility
of this terrible thing being true.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis no such thing, Nick Dodd, an&#8217; you know it! Wasn&#8217;t I
there, right alongside, when&#8217;t happened? Wasn&#8217;t I
a-listenin&#8217; to them very chimes a-ringin&#8217; what he listens
to every time he gets a chanst? Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d know
my own grandpa when I saw him? Huh!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Did</i>&#8211;you see him, Glory Beck? How&#8217;d come
them amberlance fellers let a kid like you get nigh enough to see a
thing? Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory gasped as the remembrance came that she had not really seen
the injured man but that the slight glimpse of his clothing and his
white hair had been, indeed, very like her grandfather&#8217;s. Still,
this awful thing could not, should not be true! Better far that dreaded
place, Snug Harbor, where, at least, he would be alive and well cared
for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I got nigh. I got nigh enough to get knocked down my own
self, an&#8217; be picked up by one them &#8216;finest&#8217; p&#8217;licemens,
what marches on Broadway. He shook me fit to beat an&#8217; set me on
the sidewalk an&#8217; scolded me hard, but I didn&#8217;t care, &#8217;cause
I was so glad to keep alive an&#8217; not be tooken off to a hospital,
like that old man was. Huh! You needn&#8217;t go thinkin&#8217; nor
sayin&#8217; that was Grandpa Simon Beck, &#8217;cause I know better. I
shan&#8217;t have it that &#8217;twas, so there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory&#8217;s argument but half-convinced herself and only
strengthened Nick&#8217;s opinion. However, his own mind was troubled.
He felt very guilty for having guided Miss Bonnicastle to the littlest
house, and the quarter-dollar earned by that treacherous deed seemed to
burn through his pocket into his very flesh. Besides that coin, he had
others in store, having had a successful morning, and the feeling of
his affluence added to another feeling slowly awakening within him.
This struggling emotion may have been generosity and it may have been
remorse. Whatever it was, it prompted him to say, &#8220;Look-a-here,
Glory, I&#8217;ll help ye. I&#8217;ve got to go get somethin&#8217;
t&#8217;eat, first off. Then, listen, you hain&#8217;t got no money, have
ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What o&#8217; that? I&#8217;ve got eyes, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve
got Bo&#8217;sn. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to the ferry an&#8217; I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; tell the ferry man just how &#8217;tis. That I must&#8211;I
must be let go over to that Staten Island on that boat, whether or no.
Me an&#8217; a dog won&#8217;t take up much room, an&#8217;, if he
won&#8217;t let me, I&#8217;ll wait round till I get some sort o&#8217;
job an&#8217; earn the money to pay. You needn&#8217;t think, Nick
Parson, that a teeny thing like a few centses will keep me from
grandpa. I&#8217;d go to Toni an&#8217; ask him only&#8211;only&#8211;I
don&#8217;t know a thing what come o&#8217; that fifty-five cents the
lady paid for the goobers, an&#8217; so I s&#8217;pose he&#8217;d be mad
an&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t trust me. Besides, grandpa always said to &#8216;Pay
as you go,&#8217; an&#8217; now I seem&#8211;I seem&#8211;to want to do
what he told more&#8217;n ever. O Nick Dodd! What if&#8211;what
if&#8211;he shouldn&#8217;t never&#8211;never
come&#8211;no&#8211;more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Glory&#8217;s courage gave way at last and, without ado, she
flung herself upon Nick as she had done upon Bo&#8217;sn and clung to him as
chokingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, this is a purty fix, now ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; thought
the victim of her embrace, casting a wary eye up and down the Lane,
lest any mate should see and gibe at him, and call him a
&#8220;softy.&#8221; Besides, for Glory to become sentimental&#8211;if
this was sentiment&#8211;was as novel as for him to be generous. So, to
relieve the situation, the newsboy put these two new things together
and wrenched himself free, saying, &#8220;Quit it, Glory Beck! I got to
breathe same&#8217;s another, ain&#8217;t I? You look a-here. See that
cash? Well, I&#8217;ll tell ye, I&#8217;ll go fetch my grub&#8213;Had
any yerself, Glory Beck?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was spoken like an accusation and Glory resented it,
answering quickly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know as that&#8217;s
anythin&#8217; to you, Nick Parson!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course. But I&#8217;ll fetch enough fer two an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll tell ye, I&#8217;ll go to that &#8216;Snug Harbor&#8217; my own
self, a payin&#8217; my own way, I will. I can afford it an&#8217; you
can&#8217;t. If so be the cap&#8217;n &#8217;s there, I&#8217;ll fetch him
out lickety-cut. If he ain&#8217;t, why then, &#8217;twas him was
killed. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t see. Maybe they wouldn&#8217;t let a boy
in, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! They&#8217;re sure to. Ain&#8217;t I on the papers?
Don&#8217;t newsboys go anywhere they want, same&#8217;s other press
folks? Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory admitted that they did. She had often seen them jumping on and
off of street cars at the risk of their lives and without hindrance
from the officials. Also, the lad&#8217;s offer to share his breakfast
with her was too tempting to be declined. As he hurried away toward his
poor home, she sat down on the threshold of the warehouse before which
they had talked to wait, calling after him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget a
bite for Bo&#8217;sn, Nick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; he returned, and disappeared within his own
cellar doorway.</p>

<p>Already Glory&#8217;s heart was happier. She would not allow herself
to think it possible that her grandfather was hurt, and Nick&#8217;s
willingness to help was a comfort. Maybe he would even take her with
him, though she doubted it. However, she put the question to him as he
reappeared with some old scraps in a torn newspaper, but while they
were enjoying these as best they could and sharing the food with Bo&#8217;sn,
Nick unfolded a better plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye see, Take-a-Stitch, it&#8217;s this way&#8211;no use
wastin&#8217; eight cents on a old ferry when four&#8217;ll do. You
look all over Broadway again. Then, if he ain&#8217;t anywheres &#8217;round
there, go straight to them other crony captains o&#8217; hisn an&#8217;
see. Bein&#8217;s he can&#8217;t tell difference &#8217;twixt night an&#8217;
day, how&#8217;d he know when to come back to the Lane,
anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He always come &#8217;fore,&#8221; answered Glory, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>It was a new thing for Nick to take the lead in anything which
concerned the little girl, who was the recognized leader of all the
Lane children, and it made him both proud and more generous. Yielding
to a wild impulse that now seized him, with a gesture of patronage, he
drew from his pocket Miss Bonnicastle&#8217;s quarter and dropped it in
Glory&#8217;s lap.</p>

<p>She stared at it, then almost gasped the question,
&#8220;What&#8211;what&#8217;s it for, Nick Dodd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fer&#8211;you!&#8221; cried the boy. He might have added that
it was &#8220;conscience money,&#8221; and that the unpleasant burning
in his pocket had entirely ceased the instant he had rid himself of the
ill-gotten coin, because at the time he had guided Miss Laura to the
littlest house he had not tarried to learn how fruitless her visit was;
else he might have felt less like a traitor. As it was, he tossed his
head and answered loftily, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do fer girls to go
trav&#8217;lin&#8217; round &#8217;ithout cash. You ain&#8217;t workin&#8217;
to-day an&#8217;&#8211;an&#8217; ye may need it. Newspaper
men&#8211;well, we can scrape along &#8217;most anyhow. Hello, here&#8217;s
Buttons!&#8221;</p>

<p>A cheery whistle announced the arrival of the third member of this
intimate trio, and presently Billy came in sight around the Elbow, his
freckled face as gay as the morning despite the facts that he still
carried some unsold papers under his arm and that he had just emerged
from a street fight, rather the worse for that event.</p>

<p>Glory&#8217;s fastidiousness was shocked, and, forgetting her own
trouble in disgust at his carelessness, she exclaimed, &#8220;You bad
Billy Buttons! There you&#8217;ve gone lost two more your buttons what
I sewed with my strongest thread this very last day ever was! An&#8217;
your jacket&#8213;What you been doin&#8217; with yourself, Billy
Buttons?&#8221;</p>

<p>The newcomer seated himself between his friends, though in so doing
he crowded Nick from the door-sill to the sidewalk, and composedly
helped himself to what was left of their scanty breakfast. Better than
nothing he found it and answered, as he ate, Glory&#8217;s repeated
inquiry, &#8220;What doin&#8217;? Why, scrappin&#8217;, &#8217;course. Say,
parson, you hear me? They&#8217;s a new feller come on our beat
an&#8217; you chuck him, soon&#8217;s ye see him. I jest punched him to
beat, but owe him &#8217;nother, &#8217;long o&#8217; this tear. Sew it,
Take-a-Stitch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, Billy. I&#8217;ve got to hunt grandpa. Oh,
Billy, Billy, he hain&#8217;t never come home!&#8221;</p>

<p>The newsboy paused in the munching of a crust and whistled, but this
time in dismay rather than good cheer. Then he demanded, &#8220;What ye
givin&#8217; us?&#8221;</p>

<p>The others explained, both talking at once, though Master Buttons
soon silenced his partner in trade that he might better hear the
girl&#8217;s own story. When she had finished, and now with a fresh
burst of tears, he whistled again; then ordered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit snivelin&#8217;, Glory Beck! A man ain&#8217;t dead till
he dies, is he? More&#8217;n likely &#8217;twas the old cap&#8217;n got hurt
but that ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;. Why, them hospitals is all chuck
full o&#8217; smash-up folks, an&#8217; it&#8217;s jest meat fer them
doctor-fellers to mend &#8217;em again. He ain&#8217;t dead, an&#8217;
don&#8217;t you believe it; but dead or alive we&#8217;ll find him
&#8217;fore dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fer onct,&#8221; continued Billy, &#8220;the parson&#8217;s
showed some sense. He might&#8217;s well do the &#8216;Harbor,&#8217; &#8217;cause
that&#8217;s only one place an&#8217; he can&#8217;t blunder
much&#8211;seems if. You take the streets, same&#8217;s he said; and
I&#8211;if you&#8217;ll put a needle an&#8217; thread through me,
bime-by, after he&#8217;s found, I&#8217;ll go find him an&#8217; call
it square. I&#8217;ll begin to the lowest down end the city hospitals
they is an&#8217; I&#8217;ll interview &#8217;em, one by one, clean up
to the Bronx. If Cap&#8217;n Beck is in any one, I&#8217;ll fetch him out,
judge, an&#8217; don&#8217;t you forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This division of the search pleased Glory and, springing up, the
trio separated at once, nor did they meet again till nightfall. Alas!
when reassembled then in the littlest house none had good news to
tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t been no new old cap&#8217;ns tooken in to that
&#8216;Harbor&#8217; this hull week. Th&#8217; sailor what keeps the gate
said so an&#8217; was real decent. Said he&#8217;d heard o&#8217; Cap&#8217;n
Beck, he had, an&#8217; if he&#8217;d a-come he&#8217;d a-knowed. Told
me better call ag&#8217;in, might get there yet, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
go,&#8221; reported Nick, putting a cheerful tone into his words for
pity of Glory&#8217;s downcast face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t do a quarter th&#8217; hospitals they is, but he
ain&#8217;t in none them I have,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ll tell ye. They&#8217;s a man on our force reports all the
accidentses an&#8217; I&#8217;ll see him to-night, when I go for my
papers, an&#8217; get him to hunt, too. He&#8217;s worth while
an&#8217; me an&#8217; him&#8217;s sort o&#8217; pardners. I give him
p&#8217;ints an&#8217; he &#8217;lows I&#8217;ll be a reporter myself, when
I&#8217;m bigger. An&#8217; say, I sold a pape&#8217; to a man
couldn&#8217;t stop fer change an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got three
cream-puffs in this bag. That&#8217;s fer our suppers, an&#8217; me
an&#8217; Nick&#8217;s goin&#8217; to stay right here all night
an&#8217; take care of ye, Take-a-Stitch, an&#8217; leave the door
open, so cap&#8217;n can come straight in if he happens &#8217;long &#8217;fore
mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve been to every single place he ever sung
at, every single. An&#8217; to all the captains,
an&#8217;&#8211;an&#8217;&#8211;every, everywhere! An&#8217; he
ain&#8217;t! But I will find him. I <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>will!&#8221;</span> cried Glory,
resolutely. &#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;re dear, dear darlin&#8217; boys
to help me so, an&#8217; I love you, I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, but needn&#8217;t bother to hug me!&#8221;
protested Buttons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ner me!&#8221; cried Nick, retreating as far from the
grateful child as the limited space would permit. &#8220;An&#8217; now
choose corners. This is mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down he dropped in the inner point of the triangular floor and
almost before his head had made itself a pillow of his arm he was sound
asleep. Billy flung himself beside his mate and, also, slept; and
though Glory intended to keep her eyes wide open &#8220;till grandpa
comes,&#8221; she placed herself near them and rested her own tired
head on Billy&#8217;s shoulder, and, presently, followed their
example.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, the Lane policeman sauntered by, glanced into
the dim interior, and saw the group of indistinct forms huddled
together in dreamless slumber on their bed of bare boards. Then he
softly closed the door upon them, murmuring in pity, &#8220;Poor little
chummies! Life&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be as hard for &#8217;em as the
floor they lie on. But the Lane&#8217;d seem darker &#8217;n &#8217;tis if
they wasn&#8217;t in it.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Guardian Angel</span></h2>

<p>City newsboys are early astir, and the shadows had but begun to lift
themselves from Elbow Lane when Billy punched Nick in the ribs to rouse
him and, with finger on lip, pointed to Glory still asleep.</p>

<p>The very poor pity the poor, and with a chivalric kindness which
would have done credit to better reared lads, these two waifs of the
streets stole softly from the littlest house without waking its small
mistress.</p>

<p>When they were out upon the sidewalk, Billy shook his head and
whispered, as if even there he might disturb her, &#8220;Poor little
kid! He ain&#8217;t never comin&#8217; back, sure! An&#8217; me
an&#8217; you &#8217;s got the job o&#8217; lookin&#8217; after her,
same &#8217;s he&#8217;d a liked. He was good to me, the cap&#8217;n was.
An&#8217; I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; Meg-Laundress&#8217;s &#8217;ll be
the best place to stow her. Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meg can&#8217;t. She&#8217;s chuck full. They ain&#8217;t a
corner o&#8217; her room but what&#8217;s slep&#8217; in, an&#8217; you
know it,&#8221; responded Nick, hitching his buttonless knickers a
trifle higher beneath the string-waistband which kept them in
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where then, pard?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick hesitated. On the day before he had developed a generosity
which had surprised himself quite as much as it had Glory; but, if
allowed room, generosity is a plant of rapid growth, so that now the
once niggardly boy was ready with a plan that was even more
astonishing. His thin face flushed and he pretended to pick a sliver
from his foot as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s me an&#8217; you hire the littles&#8217; house
an&#8217; pay the rent ourselves an&#8217; Goober Glory do our
cookin&#8217; an&#8217; sewin&#8217;
an&#8217;&#8211;an&#8217;&#8211;quit yer foolin&#8217;, Billy Buttons!
This ain&#8217;t no make-b&#8217;lieve, this ain&#8217;t. I plumb mean
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>For, the instant of its suggestion, this wild scheme had sent the
partner of Nick Dodd&#8217;s fortunes to turning somersaults which
would have befitted an acrobat. To put his head where his feet should
be was Billy&#8217;s only way of relieving his emotion and he brought
his gymnastics to an end, some distance down the Lane, by assuming a
military uprightness and bowing profoundly to Nick, who joined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket, pard! We&#8217;ll do it! We&#8217;ll
do it! Wish to goodness I&#8217;d been the one to hatch it out, but
does ye proud, parson. An&#8217; how &#8217;bout it? S&#8217;pose we two
could sleep in his hammick?&#8221; asked Billy, his eagerness already
outstripping Nick&#8217;s, as his liberality had always been
greater.</p>

<p>Nick shook his head. Launched upon a course of reckless
extravagance, he now hesitated at nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope. Nothin&#8217;. What&#8217;s the matter buyin&#8217;
&#8217;nother? An&#8217;, say, we can sling &#8217;em one top th&#8217;
other, like them berths in a sleepin&#8217; car, an&#8217; take turns
which &#8217;d be upper, which lower. &#8217;Fore winter we&#8217;d get in a
blanket an&#8217; piller, though wouldn&#8217;t care much for
&#8217;em, in such a snug place, an&#8217;&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217;,&#8221; interrupted Billy, &#8220;we&#8217;d go
snooks on the grub. Glory&#8217;d do her part chuckin&#8217; in, &#8217;sides
the housekeep. My! &#8217;Twould be a home, a reg&#8217;lar home, &#8217;at I
hain&#8217;t never had! Cracky! I&#8211;I &#8217;most hope he never does come
now, though fer Take-a-Stitch&#8211;maybe&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t never. Don&#8217;t ye scare on it, never. Say!
Let&#8217;s hurry through our sellin&#8217; an&#8217; get it fixed.
An&#8217; we&#8217;re late, a&#8217;ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; and with visions of a delightful
importance, that made them feel as if they were grown men, the little
fellows scampered away through the morning twilight to obtain their
day&#8217;s supply of newspapers, still damp from the press, for they
had long ago learned that &#8217;tis the early newsboy who catches the
nickels and of these they must now have many. Neither realized that a
property owner, even of a &#8220;littlest house,&#8221; would not be
apt to trust it to a pair of youngsters like themselves, though to
their credit it was that had their dream become reality, they would
have done their utmost to follow the example of the former tenant to
&#8220;pay as you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had long been shrilling themselves hoarse with their cries of
&#8220;Sun&#8217; &#8217;Eral&#8217;Jour&#8217;Wor&#8211;rul&#8217;! Pape&#8217;s!&#8221;
before Glory woke and found herself alone. By the light in the room and
the hunger she felt, she knew that it must again be very late; and a
feeling that her grandfather would be displeased with her indolence
sent her to her feet with such speed that she awoke Bo&#8217;sn, till then
slumbering soundly.</p>

<p>Bo&#8217;sn was no longer young and, stiff from an all day&#8217;s
tramp&#8211;for he had faithfully followed the little girl&#8217;s
tireless search of yesterday&#8211;he rose slowly and stretched himself
painfully, with a growl at his own aching joints. Then he sniffed
suspiciously at the floor where the newsboys had slept and, nosing his
master&#8217;s hammock, howled dismally.</p>

<p>Having slept without undressing, Glory&#8217;s toilet was soon made
and though a dash of cold water banished drowsiness from her eyes it
made them see more clearly how empty and desolate the &#8220;littlest
house&#8221; had now become, so desolate that she could not stay in it
and running to Meg-Laundress&#8217;s crowded apartment, she burst in,
demanding, &#8220;Has he come? Has anybody in the Lane seen my
grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>Meg desisted from spanking the &#8220;baddest o&#8217; them
twins&#8221; and set the small miscreant upon the sudsy floor before
she answered, cheerfully, &#8220;Not yet, honey. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t scurce
time to be lookin&#8217; fer him, I reckon. When them old sailors gets
swappin&#8217; yarns needn&#8217;t&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Meg dear, he ain&#8217;t at any one of their houses.
I&#8217;ve been to the hull lot&#8211;two er three times to each one,
a-yest&#8217;day&#8211;an&#8217; he wasn&#8217;t. An&#8217; they
think&#8211;I dastn&#8217;t think what they think! An&#8217; I thought
maybe&#8211;he always liked you, Meg-Laundress, an&#8217; said you done
his shirts to beat. Oh, Meg, Meg, what shall I do? Whatever shall I
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The warm-hearted washerwoman thrilled with pity for the forsaken
child yet she put on her most brilliant surface-smile and answered
promptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do? Why, do jest what Jane an&#8217; me laid out to have ye
do. An&#8217; that is, eat a grand breakfast. We ain&#8217;t such old
friends o&#8217; the cap&#8217;n&#8217;s an&#8217; yet go let his folks
starve. Me an&#8217; Jane, we done it together, an&#8217; the
grocer-man threw in the rolls. There&#8217;s a cunnin&#8217; little
piece o&#8217; porterhouse&#8217;s ever ye see, an&#8217;
&#8217;taties&#8211;biled to the queen&#8217;s taste with their brown jackets
on. Two of &#8217;em, an&#8217; no scantin&#8217;, nuther. No, you
small rapscallions, ye clear out! &#8217;Tain&#8217;t none your breakfasts,
ye hear? It&#8217;s Goober Glory&#8217;s an&#8217;&#8211;you all, the
half-dozen on ye, best clear out way beyant th&#8217; Elbow an&#8217;
watch out fer the banan&#8217; man! If he comes to the Lane, ma&#8217;s
got a good wash on hand, an&#8217;&#8211;<i>who knows?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Away scampered Meg&#8217;s brood of children, assorted sizes, yet
one and all with a longing for &#8220;banan&#8217; cheap!&#8221; and
sure that no amount of coaxing would give them a share in the savory
breakfast which the two toiling women had provided for Glory.</p>

<p>Left comfortably free from crowding, Meg bustled about, removing
from the small oven the belated &#8220;steak an&#8217; &#8217;taties&#8221;
which had long been drying there. In this removal, she clumsily tilted
the boiler in which her &#8220;wash&#8221; was bubbling and flavored
the meal with a dash of soapsuds, but Glory was more hungry than
critical, and far more grateful than either. Smiles and tears both came
as she caught Meg&#8217;s wet hand and kissed it ecstatically, which
action brought a suspicious moisture to Meg&#8217;s own eyes and caused
her to exclaim, with playful reproof:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you ain&#8217;t the beatin&#8217;est one fer huggin&#8217;
an&#8217; kissin&#8217;! Well, then, set to; an&#8217; hear me tell:
this is what me an&#8217; Jane has settled, how the very minute the
cap&#8217;n heaves in sight down the Lane, on I claps the very pattron
o&#8217; that same stuff ye&#8217;re eatin&#8217; for him, an&#8217;
calls it breakfast, dinner, er supper, as the case is. When folks have
been off visitin&#8217;, like he has, they can&#8217;t &#8217;spect to
find things ready to hand to their own houses, same&#8217;s if
they&#8217;d been round all the time. Now, eat, an&#8217; &#8216;let your
victuals stop yer mouth&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was luxurious food for one accustomed to an oatmeal diet and
Glory heartily enjoyed it, although she wished she could have given it
to her grandfather instead, but she wasn&#8217;t one to borrow trouble
and relied upon Meg&#8217;s word that a similar repast should be
forthcoming when the seaman required it. She did not know that the very
odor of the food set the washerwoman&#8217;s own mouth to watering and
that she had to swallow fast and often, to convince herself that her
own breakfast of warmed-over coffee and second-hand rolls was wholly
sufficient. In any case, both she and Posy Jane had delighted in their
self-sacrifice for the little &#8220;Queen of the Lane,&#8221; in their
hearts believing that the child was now orphaned, indeed.</p>

<p>It is amazing how, when one is extremely hungry, even two whole
potatoes will disappear, and very speedily Glory found that the cracked
plate from which she had eaten was entirely empty, but, also, that the
uncomfortable hunger had disappeared with its vanished contents. She
sprang up, ran to the spigot, washed and wiped the plate, and restored
it to its place on Meg&#8217;s scanty cupboard, then announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall tell my grandpa how good all you dear, dear folks has
been to me while he&#8211;he was off a-visitin&#8217;. An&#8217;
he&#8217;ll do somethin&#8217; nice for you, too, he will. My
grandfather says &#8216;giff-gaff makes good friends,&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;one
kind turn &#8217;serves another.&#8217; He knows a lot, grandpa does;
an&#8217; me an&#8217; him both thanks you, Meg-Laundress&#8211;you
darlin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Away around the big neck of the woman at the tub went Glory&#8217;s
slender arms, and when the patient toiler released herself from this
inconvenient embrace, there was something besides soapsuds glistening
on her hot cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless ye an&#8217; save ye, honey sweetness, an&#8217; may
yer guardian angel keep ye in close sight, the hull endurin&#8217;
time!&#8221; cried the laundress, wiping her eyes with a wet towel to
disguise that other moisture which had gathered in them.
&#8220;An&#8217; now, be off with ye to the little Eyetalian with the
high-soundin&#8217; name. Sure, &#8217;twas Nick, the parson, hisself,
what seen them fifty-five centses was in the right hands, an&#8217; not
scattered by that power o&#8217; young ones as was hangin&#8217; round
when the lady give &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he take them? Oh, I&#8217;m so glad an&#8217; it&#8217;s
queer he should ha&#8217; forgot to tell me last night. Never mind,
though. I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to peddle to-day. I shan&#8217;t
peddle no more till I find grandpa. I couldn&#8217;t. I couldn&#8217;t
holler even, worth listenin&#8217;. An&#8217; who&#8217;d buy off a
girl what can&#8217;t holler?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. I don&#8217; know. Hollerin&#8217;s the life o&#8217;
your trade, same&#8217;s rub-a-dub-dubbin&#8217; &#8217;s the life
o&#8217; mine, er puttin&#8217; the freshest flower to the front the
bunch is o&#8217; Jane&#8217;s. But, land, &#8216;Queenie,&#8217; you best
not wait fer the cap&#8217;n. Best keep a doin&#8217;, an&#8217; onct
you&#8217;re at it again, the holler&#8217;ll come all right. Like
myself&#8211;jest let me stan&#8217; up afore this here tub an&#8217;
the wash begins to do itself, unbeknownst like. Don&#8217;t you idle.
Keep peddlin&#8217; er patchin&#8217;, though peddlin&#8217;s the least
lonesome, an&#8217; the time&#8217;ll fly like lightnin&#8217;.
It&#8217;s them &#8217;at don&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; &#8217;at don&#8217;t know
what to do. Ain&#8217;t many them sort in the Lane, though, thank the
dear Lord. Hey? What?&#8221;</p>

<p>For Glory still lingered in the doorway and her face showed that she
had no intention of following the laundress&#8217;s most sensible
advice. So when that loquacious woman paused so long that the little
girl &#8220;could get a word in edgewise,&#8221; she firmly stated:</p>

<p>&#8220;No Meg, dear Meg, I shan&#8217;t peddle a single goober till
I&#8217;ve found my grandpa. Every minute of every hour I&#8217;m awake
I shall keep a-lookin&#8217;. He hain&#8217;t got nobody but me left
an&#8217; I hain&#8217;t got nobody but him. What belongs, I mean.
&#8217;Course, they&#8217;s all you dear Lane folks an&#8217; I love you,
every one. But me an&#8217; him&#8211;I&#8211;I must, <i>must</i> find
him. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to start right away now,
an&#8217;&#8211;thank you, thank you an&#8217; dear Posy
Jane&#8211;an&#8217;&#8211;good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>This time it was Meg who caught the other in her arms and under
pretense of smoothing tumbled curls, hugged the child in motherly
yearning over her; then she gave her a very clean-smelling, sudsy kiss
and pushed her toward the door, crying rather huskily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, run away now, any gate. If to peddlin&#8217;
&#8217;twould be best; if to s&#8217;archin&#8217; fer one old blind man in
this big Ne&#8217; York what&#8217;s full of &#8217;em as haymows
o&#8217; needles, so be it, an&#8217; good luck to ye. But what am I to
be preachin&#8217; work an&#8217; practicin&#8217; play? Off with ye
an&#8217; hender me no more!&#8221;</p>

<p>So to the tune of a vigorous rub-a-dub-dub, Glory vanished from her
good friend&#8217;s sight, though the hearts of both would have ached
could they have foreseen how long delayed would be their next
meeting.</p>

<p>Comforted and now wholly hopeful that her determined search would
have a speedy, happy ending, Take-a-Stitch hurried back to the littlest
house whose narrow door stood open to its widest, yet she paused on the
threshold, amazed, incredulous, not daring to enter and scarcely daring
to breathe, lest she disturb the wonderful vision which confronted
her.</p>

<p>For the desolate home was no longer desolate. There was one within
who seemed to fill its dim interior with a radiance and beauty beyond
anything the child of the Lane had ever dreamed. Meg&#8217;s words and
wish returned to her and, clasping her hands, she cried in rapture,
&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s come! My Guardian Angel!&#8221;</p>

<h2><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span
class='h2fs'>With Bonny as Guide</span></h2>

<p>Glory was truthful and loving, and her grandfather had taught her to
be clean, honest, and industrious, but, beyond this, she had had little
training. She knew that Meg-Laundress and Posy Jane both firmly
believed in &#8220;Guardian Angels&#8221; who hovered about human
beings to protect and prosper them. She had inferred that these
&#8220;Angels&#8221; were very beautiful but had never asked if they
were ever visible or, if so, what form they took.</p>

<p>Glory felt now that she would never need to ask about the
&#8220;Angels&#8221; for the small creature before her answered all
these unspoken inquiries; a mite of a thing, in silken white, with
glistening golden curls and the roundest, loveliest of big blue eyes,
who sat on the floor smiling and gurgling in an unknown language, yet
gravely regarding Bo&#8217;sn who, firm upon his haunches, as gravely
regarded this astonishing intruder. The tiny visitor was so unlike any
crony captain or ragged newsboy that the dog was perplexed, yet as
evidently pleased, for his eyes were shining, his mouth
&#8220;laughing&#8221; and his stump of a tail doing its utmost to wag.
As Glory appeared in the doorway, he cast one welcoming glance over his
shoulder, then with the same intensity, returned to his contemplation
of the child.</p>

<p>After all, it was not an &#8220;Angel&#8221; from a spiritual world,
but a wonderfully fair and winning little human being. From whence she
had come and why, she was too young to explain and Glory was too
delighted to care. Here she was, gay, shining, and wholly undisturbed,
and, as the little goober girl appeared, the baby lifted her face,
laughing, and lisping: &#8220;Bonny come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Angels&#8221; could use human speech then; and now her awe of
the visitant vanished and down went Take-a-Stitch beside Bo&#8217;sn and
clasped the little one close and kissed and caressed it to her
heart&#8217;s content, which meant much to Glory, because even grandpa
had objected to overmuch caressing, though this newcomer appeared to
take kissing as a matter of course and to like it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you darlin&#8217;, darlin&#8217;, sweetest &#8216;Angel&#8217;!
Have you truly come to live with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny come!&#8221; answered the other, thrusting her tiny
hands into Glory&#8217;s own curls and pressing her dewy lips to
Glory&#8217;s cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you precious, precious, sweetest, darlin&#8217;est one. Oh,
won&#8217;t grandpa be pleased! An&#8217; you&#8217;ll
help&#8211;that&#8217;s what you come for, ain&#8217;t
it?&#8211;you&#8217;ll help to find him. Why, if you&#8217;re a truly
&#8216;Angel,&#8217; you know this minute &#8217;t ever is just where to
search, an&#8217; so &#8217;twon&#8217;t be more&#8217;n a bit of a while
&#8217;fore me an&#8217; you an&#8217; him is all back here together in this
splendid littlest house, a &#8217;livin&#8217; in peace an&#8217; dyin&#8217;
in grease an&#8217; bein&#8217; buried under a pot o&#8217;
taller,&#8217; like Nick&#8217;s stories end; only I guess we&#8217;ll
do without the grease an&#8217; taller, &#8217;cause I hate dirt an&#8217;
&#8216;Angels&#8217; do, &#8217;course. Oh, let&#8217;s start right away!
Why&#8211;why&#8211;we might be home again, lickety-cut, if we did.
Shall we go to find grandpa, &#8216;Angel&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger toddled to her feet, Bo&#8217;sn watching the operation with
keenest interest, but once upon them, there ensued delay, for, whoever
this unknown might be, Glory herself was a very human little girl. She
could not keep her fingers from feeling and examining the exquisite
garments which clothed her visitor&#8217;s form, and at each fresh
discovery of daintiness, from the silken coat to the snowy shoes, her
exclamations of wonder and admiration grew more intense. Before she had
finished, she felt a reflex grandeur from her richly attired guest and
unconsciously gave her own scanty skirt an airy flirt, as if it had
suddenly become of proper length and color.</p>

<p>Giving the &#8220;Angel&#8221; a fresh embrace, she clasped its pink
fingers and started to follow wherever it might lead, with Bo&#8217;sn close
behind.</p>

<p>So intent was she upon her small &#8220;Guardian,&#8221; that she
did not observe a man entering the lane from the further end, else she
would have recognized him for the owner of the littlest house, come in
person to inspect his property and to learn if his rent would be
forthcoming when due; also, to prepare the captain for possible
removal, in case a certain deal, then in progress, should transfer the
three-cornered building to other hands and purposes.</p>

<p>But the gentleman saw Glory and wondered how she had come to have in
charge, in such a neighborhood, a little child so unsuited to it. By
just the one minute&#8217;s time which would have brought him to the
littlest house ere Glory left it, she missed some further enlightenment
on the subject of &#8220;Guardian Angels,&#8221; and the sad news that
she had not only lost grandparent but home as well; for, seeing the
place open, at the mercy of any Elbow tramp who might enter and despoil
it, the landlord at once decided that, sale or no sale, he would get
rid of so careless a tenant. Crossing to the basement of Meg-Laundress,
he made some inquiries concerning the Becks and was told all which that
talkative woman knew or suspected.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; none of us in the Lane ever looks to see him back,
sir, an&#8217; that&#8217;s the fact. But whatever&#8217;s to become
o&#8217; his little girl, when she finds out, land knows,&#8221; she
concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, plenty of institutions to take in just such as she and
she&#8217;d be a deal better off than living from hand to mouth as she
has always done. The captain must have been a fine man once and so
far&#8211;so far&#8211;has had his rent money ready when it was due;
but I made it too small, a great deal too small. I was a fool for
sympathy and let my heart run away with my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know anybody would take in the old man&#8217;s few traps and
take care of them till something develops?&#8221; continued the
landlord. &#8220;He is dead, of course. Must have been him was run over
that time; but they might sell for a trifle for the child&#8217;s
benefit. I wouldn&#8217;t mind having that time-keeping arrangement of
bells myself. Was really quite ingenious. I might as well take it, I
reckon, on account of loss of occupancy. Yes, I <i>will</i> take it.
And if he should return&#8211;but he won&#8217;t&#8211;you tell him, my
good woman, how it was and he can look to me to settle. Know anybody
has room for his things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. An&#8217; if I did, I wouldn&#8217;t tell
ye,&#8221; answered Meg, testily, and as a relief to her indignation
cuffed her youngest born in lieu of him upon whom she wished she dared
bestow the correction.</p>

<p>But the corner grocery-man was more obliging and better supplied
with accommodations for Captain Beck&#8217;s belongings. In truth,
seeing that the landlord was determined, whether or no, to remove them
from the littlest house, he felt that he must take them in and preserve
them from harm against their owner&#8217;s claiming them. He thought,
with Meg, that harm had certainly befallen the blind seaman and that
they would see him no more, but he also felt that Glory&#8217;s rights
should be protected to the utmost. With this idea in mind, he stoutly
objected to parting with the bell-timepiece, and even offered to make
up any arrears of rent which the other could rightly claim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the landlord,
huffishly. &#8220;That can rest, but I wish you&#8217;d call a cart and
get the traps out now, while I&#8217;m here to superintend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you!&#8221; cried the grocer, with equal
spirit; and so fully fell in with the other&#8217;s wishes that, before
Glory had been an hour absent from the only home she could remember, it
had been emptied of its few, but well loved, furnishings and the key
had been turned upon its solitude. Thus ended, too, Nick&#8217;s brief
brilliant dream of household proprietorship.</p>

<p>However, all this fresh trouble was unknown. Whither her
&#8220;Angel&#8221; led, she was to follow; and this proved to be in
wholly a different direction from that dark end of the Lane toward the
bridge.</p>

<p>For a time the small, unconscious guide toddled along, making slow
progress toward the sound of a hand-organ which her ear had caught yet
which was still out of sight. Arrived, they joined the group of
children gathered about the grinder and his monkey, and created a
profound sensation among the gutter audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you get her? Whose she belongs?&#8221; demanded
one big girl who knew Glory and found this white-clad stranger more
interesting than even a monkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belongs to me. She&#8217;s mine; she was sent,&#8221;
returned Take-a-Stitch, with an inimitable gesture of pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Talk&#8217;s cheap. Nobody sent silk-dressed young ones
to the Lane to be took care of, Glory Beck. I don&#8217;t care, though.
Keep her, if ye want to,&#8221; returned the offended questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I shall,&#8221; laughed Glory, gaily. &#8220;But
needn&#8217;t get mad, Nancy Smith. Maybe you can get one, too.
She&#8217;s my &#8216;Guardian Angel&#8217; an&#8217; her name&#8217;s
&#8216;Bonny&#8217;; she said so. She don&#8217;t talk much, only that &#8216;Bonny
come.&#8217; Did you know &#8216;Angels&#8217; was so perfeckly lovely,
Nancy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clasping her hands, this proud proprietor of an &#8220;Angel&#8221;
smiled beatifically on all around. Even the organ-grinder came in for a
portion of that smile, though hitherto, Glory had rather disliked him
because she fancied him unkind to Jocko.</p>

<p>This organ-grinder was Luigi Salvatore, brother to Tonio, and as
well known in that locality. His amazement at seeing the child in the
goober seller&#8217;s care caused him to stop grinding; whereupon the
music also stopped and the monkey left off holding his cap to the
children, begging their pennies, to hop upon his master&#8217;s
shoulder. From thence he grinned so maliciously that the
&#8220;Angel&#8221; was frightened and hid her face in Glory&#8217;s
skirt, whereupon that proud girl realized that &#8220;Angels,&#8221; if
young, were exactly like human young things and needed comforting. Many
an Elbow baby had learned to flee for help to Glory&#8217;s arms, and
now this stranger was lifted in them and clasped closer than any other
had ever been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you sweetest, dearest Bonny Angel! Don&#8217;t you be
afraid. Glory&#8217;ll take care of ye. Don&#8217;t they have monkeys
where you lived, honey? S&#8217;pose not, less you&#8217;d ha&#8217; knowed
they wouldn&#8217;t hurt. Well, now, on we go. Which way is to grandpa,
Bonny Angel?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tiny face burrowing under Glory&#8217;s chin was partially
turned and the babyish hand pointed outward in a very imperative way.
Glory construed that she must travel in the direction indicated and,
also, that even &#8220;Angels&#8221; liked their commands to be
immediately obeyed. For when she lingered a moment to exchange
compliments with Nancy, on the subject of &#8220;stuck-up-ness&#8221;
and general &#8220;top-loftiness,&#8221; Miss Bonny brought these
amenities to a sudden close by a smart slap on Glory&#8217;s lips and a
lusty kick in the direction she wished to be carried.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Take-a-Stitch had never thought how
&#8220;Angels&#8221; should behave, else she might have been
disappointed. As it was, the child at once became dearer and more her
girlish proprietor&#8217;s &#8220;very own&#8221; because in just this
manner might Meg&#8217;s youngest have kicked and slapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Call that a &#8216;Angel&#8217; do ye, Glory Beck? &#8217;Tis no
such thing. It&#8217;s only somebody&#8217;s baby what&#8217;s got
lost. Angels are folks what live in heaven, an&#8217; they never kick
ner scratch ner ask to be carried. They don&#8217;t need. All they have
to do is to set still an&#8217; sing an&#8217; flap their wings. Huh! I
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nancy spoke with the conviction of an eyewitness, and for a time her
playmate was silenced. Then, as Bonny had now grown quiet and gave her
an opportunity, Glory demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;How <i>can</i> you know? You hain&#8217;t never been there.
Nobody hasn&#8217;t. An&#8217; you go ask Meg-Laundress. Good-bye.
Don&#8217;t be mad. I&#8217;ll be home bime-by, an&#8217; Bonny Angel
with me. She&#8217;s come to stay. She belongs, same&#8217;s all of us.
She&#8217;s a reg&#8217;lar Elbower, &#8217;now an&#8217; forevermore,&#8217; like
we say in the ring-game; an&#8217; some time, maybe, if she wants,
I&#8217;ll let her &#8216;Guardian&#8217; you somewhere. Now we&#8217;re off
to grandpa, but we&#8217;ll be back after a while. Good-bye. Maybe
Toni&#8217;ll let you peddle goobers in my place the rest the day.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny Angel, as she was from that time to be called by her new
friend, was again gurgling and smiling and gaily radiant; and for some
distance Glory sped along, equally radiant and wholly engrossed in
watching the little face so near her own. It was, indeed, perfect in
its infantile beauty and more than one passer-by paused to take a
second glance at this odd pair, so unlike, and yet so well content.</p>

<p>After a short while, the aching of her arms made Glory realize that
even infant &#8220;Angels&#8221; may become intolerably heavy, when
clothed in healthy human form and carried indefinitely, so she set the
little one down on its own small feet, though they seemed too dainty to
rest upon the smirched stones of the pavement which just there was even
more begrimed than that of the Lane itself.</p>

<p>Then she saw that they had halted beside a coal-yard in an
unfamiliar part of the city, but there were throngs of people hurrying
past them toward some point beyond, and though many observed, none
paused to address the children. Bonny was now rested and active and
merrily started in the same direction, across the gangplank to the
floor of a crowded ferry-boat. The ferry-men supposed them to belong to
some older passengers and let them pass unchallenged; nor did Bonny
Angel cease her resolute urging forward till they had come to the very
edge of the further deck and stood looking down into the river.</p>

<p>Almost at once, the boat began to move and Glory was as delighted as
Bonny by the rush of the wind on her face and by the novel sights of
the water. After all, this search for grandpa was proving the
pleasantest of outings, for, though the goober-seller had often peddled
her nuts at the landings of other ferries, she had never before crossed
any. She gave the baby a fresh deluge of kisses, exclaiming, &#8220;Oh,
you dear knowin&#8217; darlin&#8217;! He has gone this way an&#8217;
you&#8217;re leadin&#8217; me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny come!&#8221; cried the &#8220;Angel,&#8221; with a
seraphic smile.</p>

<p>Glory smiled back, all anxiety at rest. She was going to grandpa,
with this tiny &#8220;Guardian&#8221; an unerring guide. Why should one
fear aught while the sun shone so brightly, and over on the further
shore she could see trees waving and green terraces rising one above
the other? Surely, grandpa had done well to leave the dingy Lane for
such a beautiful place, and she was glad, yes, certainly she was glad
that she had come.</p>

<p>But the boat trip came to an end all too soon, and, because they
were so near the landing side, they were crowded off the broad deck
before Glory was quite ready and, in the onrush of hurrying passengers,
Bonny Angel&#8217;s hand was wrested from her grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, take care there, my Angel! I mustn&#8217;t lose
her!&#8221; cried Take-a-Stitch, distraught at seeing her treasure
swept off her tiny feet in the crush.</p>

<p>&#8220;In course you mustn&#8217;t, sissy!&#8221; cried a hearty,
kindly voice, as a timely deck-hand caught up the child and restored
her to Glory&#8217;s arms. &#8220;&#8217;Course not; though there&#8217;s
many a one would snap at such a beauty, if you give &#8217;em a chance.
Tight-hold her, sissy, for such posies as her don&#8217;t grow on every
bush!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, the man in blue shirt and overalls not only gave Bonny a
besmirching pat on her snowy shoulder, but safely handed Glory herself
across the swaying plank to the quay beyond.</p>

<p>There Bonny Angel composedly seated herself upon a pile of dirty
ropes and, rather than cross her desires, Glory also sat down. Both
were much interested in the scene about them, though
&#8220;Angel&#8221; soon forgot all else save Bo&#8217;sn who had followed,
and who lay at her feet to rest his nose on his tired paws while he
steadfastly gazed at this new charge. Already he seemed to have decided
in his canine mind that she was to be guided and guarded as he had
guided and guarded his lost master, and with an equal faithfulness.</p>

<p>Soon the rush and bustle of the boat&#8217;s return trip gave way to
a corresponding quiet, and Goober Glory dreamily watched the wide deck,
where she had stood, slip back and back between the water-worn piles
out upon the murky river. The space between them widened and widened,
continually, till the boat lessened in size to a mere point and,
finally, became lost in the crowding craft of the Hudson&#8217;s mouth.
As she saw it disappear, a sudden homesickness seized her and,
springing to her feet, she stretched her arms longingly toward that
further side which held all that she had ever known and loved, and
cried aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I want to go back! It&#8217;s there I belong, and he
isn&#8217;t here&#8211;I know he isn&#8217;t here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she felt a small hand clutch her skirt and turned about to see
Bonny Angel&#8217;s face clouding with grief and her dainty under lip
beginning to quiver piteously. A world of reproach seemed to dwell in
her pleading, &#8220;Bonny come!&#8221; and Glory&#8217;s own
cheerfulness instantly returned. Lifting the child again, she poised
her on her own shoulder and started valiantly forward across the
ferry-slip and past the various stands of the small merchants which
lined the waiting-room walls. Thus elevated, Bonny Angel was just upon
a level with one tempting display of cakes and candies, and the sight
of them reminded her that it was time to eat. She took her arm from
Glory&#8217;s neck, to which she had clung, made an unexpected dash for
a heap of red confections, lost her balance, and fell head long in the
midst.</p>

<h2><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>In the Ferry-House</span></h2>

<p>Then up rose the old woman behind the stand, ready with tongue and
fist to punish this destroyer of her stock; for the truth was that Miss
Bonny was not an &#8220;Angel&#8221; at all, but what Nancy Smith had
so common-sensibly judged her to be&#8211;a lost child. Such a plump
and substantial child, as well, that her downfall crushed to a crimson
flood the red &#8220;drops&#8221; she would have seized and utterly
demolished another pile of perishable cakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Save us and help us! You clumsy girl! What you mean,
hurlin&#8217; that young one onto my stand, that way? Well,
you&#8217;ve spoiled a power of stuff an&#8217; I only hope you can pay
for it on the spot!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, the irate vendor snatched Bonny from the stand and
dropped her upon the floor beyond it; where, terrified both by her fall
and this rough treatment, she set up such a wail that further scolding
was prevented. More than that, instead of being properly abashed by her
own carelessness, Glory was far more concerned that Bonny&#8217;s
beautiful coat was stained and ruined and its owner&#8217;s heart so
grieved. Down she dropped beside her &#8220;Guardian,&#8221; showering
kisses upon her, and comforting her so tenderly that the baby forgot
her fear and began to lick the sticky fluid, which had filled the
&#8220;drops,&#8221; from her sleeve that it had smeared.</p>

<p>This restored quiet so that the vender could demand payment for the
damage she had swiftly estimated, and she thrust her hand toward the
pair on the floor, saying, &#8220;Hand me over a dollar, and be quick
about it! Ought to be more, seein&#8217;s it&#8217;ll take me half a
day to straighten up and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dollar! Why&#8211;why, I never had so much in my hull life!
an&#8217; not a single cent now. Yes&#8211;they&#8217;s a quarter to
home, &#8217;t I forgot an&#8217; left in the bag, that Nick Dodd give
me&#8211;but&#8211;a dollar!&#8221; gasped poor Glory, as frightened as
surprised. Just then, too, a wharf policeman drew near and stopped to
learn what was amiss. He did not look like the jolly officer of Elbow
Lane and the stand-woman seemed sure of his sympathy as she rapidly
related her side of the story.</p>

<p>He listened in silence, and visions of patrol wagons, and the police
stations where arrested persons were confined, rose before poor
Glory&#8217;s fancy, while with frantic tenderness she hugged Bonny
Angel so close that the little one protested and wriggled herself free.
But no sooner was she upon her feet than the child became her own best
plea for pardon. Reaching her arms upward to be lifted, she began a
delighted examination of the brass buttons on the man&#8217;s blue
coat; and, because he had babies of his own, it seemed the natural
thing for him to do to take her up as she desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you mustn&#8217;t, you dastn&#8217;t carry her away!
She hain&#8217;t done a thing, only tumbled off my shoulder! &#8217;Twas
<i>me</i> done it, not holdin&#8217; her tight enough! An&#8217; she
can&#8217;t be &#8217;rested, she can&#8217;t! How can she, when she&#8217;s
a &#8216;Guardian Angel&#8217;? Give her back&#8211;give her back!&#8221;</p>

<p>In her distress, Take-a-Stitch herself laid violent hands upon the
blue sleeves which so strongly enfolded her darling and would have
wrested them apart had strength sufficed. As it was, the helmeted
officer looked calmly down upon her anguished face and quietly
whistled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep cool, sissy, keep cool. Wait till I hear your side the
business before you talk of arrests. Besides, this baby! Why,
she&#8217;s the prettiest little innocent I&#8217;ve seen in a
week&#8217;s beat,&#8221; said the rough voice, and now regarding the
lips through which it issued, the young &#8220;Elbower&#8221; perceived
that they were no longer stern but actually smiling.</p>

<p>Then she did talk; not only of this last adventure but, encouraged
by his close attention, of all the events of her past life. Out it
came, the whole story; Glory&#8217;s love of the Lane and its people,
her grandfather&#8217;s disappearance, the coming of Bonny Angel,
&#8220;sent to take his place an&#8217; help to find him,&#8221; her
present search and her honest regret for the injury to this old
woman&#8217;s wares.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I know how &#8217;tis myself. Onct a lady fell into my
goober basket an&#8217; smashed &#8217;em so &#8217;t I was
heart-broke. An&#8217; if ever&#8211;ever in this world I can earn a
hull dollar I&#8217;ll come right straight back here an&#8217; pay it.
Sure, sure, sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, during all this relation, though the policeman&#8217;s face
seemed to soften and grow more like that of his brother-officer of
Elbow Lane, it did not grow less grave. Indeed, a great perplexity came
into his eyes and he appeared to be far more interested in the fate of
Bonny Angel than in the voluble interruptions of Apple Kate. When Glory
paused, out of breath and with no more to tell, he set the little one
down and took out his note-book. Having made some entries there, he
exchanged a few low-spoken words with the vender and these appeared to
quiet her wrath and silence her demands. Indeed, their influence was so
powerful that she selected a pile of the broken cakes, put them into a
paper bag, and offered them to Take-a-Stitch, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, girl, it&#8217;s all right, or will be, soon&#8217;s
officer finds that young one&#8217;s folks. It&#8217;s past noon, nigh
on toward night, an&#8217; likely she was hungry, too little to know
any better, and you can have part yourself. You just do what he tells
ye, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll soon see that baby back in its
mother&#8217;s arms. Laws, how heart-broke she must be a-losin&#8217;
it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goober Glory heard and felt that her own heart was surely breaking.
Bonny Angel&#8217;s &#8220;folks&#8221;! She had some, then, since this
policeman said so&#8211;policemen knew everything&#8211;and she
wasn&#8217;t a heaven-sent &#8220;Guardian,&#8221; at all. And,
furthermore, if this was a &#8220;lost child,&#8221; she knew exactly
what would be done.</p>

<p>It would be the station house, after all, though not by way of
arrest. Meg-Laundress&#8217;s assorted children had been
&#8220;lost&#8221; on the city streets more than once and Meg
hadn&#8217;t fretted a bit. She knew well, that when her day&#8217;s
toil was over, she had but to visit the nearest station to reclaim her
missing offspring; or if not at the nearest, why then at some other
similar place in the great town, whence a telephone message would
promptly summon the child. But Bonny Angel? Station house matrons were
kind enough, and their temporary care of her brood had been a relief to
overworked Meg-Laundress; but for this beautiful
&#8220;Guardian,&#8221; they were all unfit. Only tenderest love should
ever come near so angelic a little creature and of such love
Glory&#8217;s own heart was full.</p>

<p>She reasoned swiftly. The baby was hers, by right, till that sad day
of which she had not dreamed when she must restore it to its
&#8220;folks,&#8221; whoever and wherever they were. She would so
restore it, though it break her heart; yet better her own heart
breaking than that mother-heart of which the vender spoke. To her
search for grandpa, in which Bonny Angel was guide, was now added a
search for these unknown &#8220;folks&#8221; to whom she must give the
little one up. That was all. It was very simple and very hard to do,
till one thought came to cheer her courage. By the time she found these
unknown people she would, also, have found Captain Simon Beck! She had
been supremely happy with him, always, and she would be happy again;
yet how dear, how dear this little comrade of a day had become!</p>

<p>Glory&#8217;s decisions never wavered. Once made, she acted upon
them without hesitation. She now turned to the policeman, who had
written some further items in his book and was now putting it into his
pocket, and said, &#8220;You needn&#8217;t bother, Mister P&#8217;liceman, to
find &#8217;em. I&#8217;ll take Bonny Angel home my own
self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey? What? Do know where she belongs, after all? You been
fooling me with your talk?&#8221; he asked quickly, and now with face
becoming very stern indeed. He was sadly used to dealing with deceit
but hated to find it in one so young as Goober Glory.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I never. But I will. I&#8217;d rather an&#8217; I
must&#8211;I must! Oh, I can&#8217;t let her go to that terr&#8217;ble
station house where thievers an&#8217; bad folks go, an&#8217; she so
white an&#8217; pure an&#8217; little an&#8217; sweet! I can&#8217;t.
She mustn&#8217;t. She shan&#8217;t! So there.&#8221;</p>

<p>At her own enumeration of Bonny Angel&#8217;s charms, the
girl&#8217;s heart thrilled afresh with love and admiration, and,
catching her again into her close embrace, she fell to rapturously
kissing the small face that was now &#8220;sweet&#8221; in truth, from
the sticky drops the child had licked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! If you don&#8217;t know where she belongs, nor have
any money to spend in finding out, the station&#8217;s the only place.
It&#8217;s the first place, too, she&#8217;ll be looked for, and
she&#8217;ll be well cared for till claimed. You can go along with her,
maybe, since you appear to be lost, too,&#8221; remarked the officer.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m wasting time. You stop right here by Apple
Kate&#8217;s stand, while I step yonder and telephone headquarters. A
man&#8217;ll come over next boat and take you both back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chance of going &#8220;back&#8221; to the city whose very paving
stones now seemed dear to her did, for an instant, stagger
Glory&#8217;s decision. But only for an instant. Bonny Angel was still
the guide. It was Bonny Angel who had brought them to this further
shore where, beyond this great, noisy ferry-house were those green
terraces and waving trees. It was here, separated by the wide river
from all familiar scenes, that her search must go on.</p>

<p>A customer came to the stand and occupied Apple Kate&#8217;s
attention, at the same time the wharf policeman walked away to send his
message concerning little Bonny. That moment was Glory&#8217;s
opportunity, and she improved it, thinking with good reason:</p>

<p>&#8220;If onct he gets a-hold on us he won&#8217;t leave us go.
He&#8217;d think it wouldn&#8217;t be right, for a p&#8217;liceman. Well,
then, he shan&#8217;t get a-hold!&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when her patron had passed on, Apple Kate
looked around and missed the children, but supposed they had followed
the officer. Yet when he came back to the stand, he denied that they
had done so and angrily inquired &#8220;why she couldn&#8217;t keep an
eye on them and oblige a man, while he just rung up
headquarters?&#8221;</p>

<p>To which she as crisply replied, &#8220;Huh! My eyes has had all
sight o&#8217; them they want, and they&#8217;ll trouble you nor me no
more. They&#8217;ve skipped, so you might &#8217;s well trot back and
ring down whatever you&#8217;ve rung up. They&#8217;ve
skipped.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>Another Stage of the Journey</span></h2>

<p>The ferry-house where the policeman had found Glory and her
&#8220;Angel&#8221; was also the terminus of a great railway. Beyond
the waiting-room were iron gates, always swinging to and fro, for the
passage of countless travelers; and from the gates stretched rows of
shining tracks. Puffing engines moved in and out upon these, drawing
mighty carriages that rumbled after with a deafening noise. Gatemen
shouted the names of the outgoing trains, whistles blew, trunk-vans
rattled, and on every side excited people called to one another some
confusing direction.</p>

<p>Glory, with Bonny Angel in her arms, had hurried up to one of these
iron gates, feeling that if she could but dash through and place that
barrier between herself and the too-faithful policeman, she would be
free at last. But the chance of so doing was long delayed. That
particular gateman appeared to prevent anybody passing him who did not
show a bit of printed cardboard, as he called, &#8220;Tickets! have
your tickets ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, oh, in what a glorious voice he so directed them!</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart! If I could holler goobers like he does them
car-trains, folks&#8217;d jest have to buy, whether er no!&#8221;
thought the little peddler, so rapt in listening that she forgot
everything else; till, at one louder yell than all, the child in her
arms shrieked in terror. At which the gateman whirled round, leaving a
space behind him, and Glory darted through.</p>

<p>Neither the official nor she knew that she was doing a prohibited
thing; for he supposed she was hurrying to overtake some older party of
travelers and she knew nothing of station rules. Once past this gate,
she found herself in dangerous nearness to the many trains and could
walk neither this way nor that without some guard shouting after her,
&#8220;Take care, there!&#8221;</p>

<p>She dared not put Bonny Angel down even if the child would have
consented, and, continually, the rumblings and whistlings grew more
confusing. In comparison with this great shed, Elbow Lane, that Miss
Bonnicastle had found so noisy, seemed a haven of quietude and Glory
heartily wished herself back in it.</p>

<p>There must be a way out of this dreadful place, and the bewildered
little girl tried to find it. Yet there behind her rose a high brick
wall in which there was no doorway, on the left were the waiting or
moving trains and their shouting guards, and on the right that iron
fence with its rolling gates and opposing gatemen, and, also, that
policeman who would have taken Bonny Angel from her. Before her rose
the north-side wall of the building, that, at first glance, seemed as
unbroken a barrier as its counterpart on the south; but closer
inspection discovered a low, open archway through which men
occasionally passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever&#8217;s beyond here can&#8217;t be no worse,&#8221;
thought Take-a-Stitch, and hurried through the opening. But once beyond
it, she could only exclaim, &#8220;Why, Bonny Angel, it&#8217;s just
the same, all tracks an&#8217; cars, though &#8217;tain&#8217;t got no roof
over! My, I don&#8217;t know how to go&#8211;an&#8217; I wish they
would keep still a minute an&#8217; let a body think!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even older people would have been confused in such a place, with
detached engines here and there, snorting and puffing back and forth in
a seemingly senseless way, its many tracks, and its wider outdoor
resemblance to the great shed she had left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess this is what Posy Jane &#8217;d call &#8216;hoppin&#8217; out
the fryin&#8217;-pan inter the fire,&#8217; Bonny Angel. It&#8217;s
worse an&#8217; more of it, an&#8217; I want to get quit of it
soon&#8217;s I can. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t no ways likely grandpa&#8217;s
hereabouts, an&#8217;&#8213;My, but you&#8217;re a hefty little
darlin&#8217;! If I wasn&#8217;t afraid to let you, I&#8217;d have ye
walk a spell. But you might get runned over by some them ingines what
won&#8217;t stay still no place an&#8217; I dastn&#8217;t, you dear,
precious sweetness, you! I shan&#8217;t put you down till I drop, &#8217;less
we get out o&#8217; this sudden.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even as she clasped her beloved burden the closer, Bonny Angel
set this decision at naught by kicking herself free from the girl too
small and weary to prevent; and once upon the ground, off she set along
a particularly shining track, cooing and shrieking her delight at her
own mischievousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! oh! oh!&#8221; screamed Glory, and started in pursuit. Of
course, she could run much faster than her &#8220;Guardian,&#8221; but
that tiny person had a way of darting sidewise, here and there, and
thus eluding capture just as it seemed certain.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the direction she had chosen led outward and away from
the maze of steel lines, and, finding no harm come of it and the child
so happy, Glory gave up trying to catch and simply followed her. Just
then, too, there came into view the sight of green tree-tops and a
glimpse of the river, and these encouraged her to proceed. Indeed, she
was now more afraid to go back than to go forward, and Bonny
Angel&#8217;s strange contentment in the care of a stranger, like
herself, renewed a belief that she was other than mere mortal, and so
above the common needs of babies.</p>

<p>Reasoned this &#8220;Little Mother&#8221; of Elbow Lane, &#8220;If
she was just plain baby an&#8217; not no &#8216;Angel,&#8217; she&#8217;d
a-cried fer her ma, an&#8217; she hain&#8217;t never, not onct. She
hain&#8217;t cried fer crusts, neither, like Meg-Laundress&#8217;s
twins is always doin&#8217;. &#8217;Course, them cakes what th&#8217; Apple
Kate give her was sweet an&#8217; a lot of &#8217;em. The crumbs I et
when Bonny Angel fired the bag away was jest like sugar. My, prime!
Some day, when I get rich, an&#8217; they ain&#8217;t nobody else
a-wantin&#8217; &#8217;em, I&#8217;ll buy myself some cakes ezackly
like them was. I will so&#8211;if they ain&#8217;t nobody else. But,
there, Glory Beck, you quit thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout eatin&#8217;
&#8217;less first you know, you&#8217;ll be hungry an&#8217; your
stummick&#8217;ll get that horrid feel again. Hi, I b&#8217;lieve it&#8217;s
comin&#8217; a&#8217;ready an&#8217; yet I had that splendid
breakfast!&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow, the idea of food occurred to this trio of travelers at one
and the same time. Bo&#8217;sn crept up to his mistress and rubbed his sides
against her legs, dumbly pleading for rest and refreshment. He was very
tired, for a dog, and as confused as Take-a-Stitch by these strange
surroundings, and acted as if unwilling to go further afield. At every
possible chance now, he would lie down on the ground and remain there
until his companions were so far in advance that he feared to be lost
himself. Surely he felt that this long road was the wrong road, where
he would listen in vain for the tap-tap of his master&#8217;s cane and
the scent of his master&#8217;s footsteps.</p>

<p>As for Bonny Angel, she suddenly paused in the midst of her
mischievous gaiety, put up her lip and began to howl as loudly and
dismally as any common Lane baby could have done. Then when her new
nurse hurried to her, distressed and self-reproachful for not having
carried her all the way, down the little one flung herself prone in the
dirt and rolled and kicked most lustily.</p>

<p>Glory did her utmost, but she could neither quiet nor lift the
struggling &#8220;Angel,&#8221; and finally she ceased her efforts and,
with arms akimbo and the wisdom of experience coolly addressed her
charge:</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Bonny Angel! You&#8217;re the sweetest thing in the
world, but that&#8217;s jest spunk, that is. You&#8217;re homesick, I
s&#8217;pose, an&#8217; tired an&#8217; hungry, an&#8217; want your ma,
an&#8217; all them bad things together makes you feel ye don&#8217;t
know how! I feel that-a-way myself, a-times, but I don&#8217;t go
rollin&#8217; in mud puddles an&#8217; sp&#8217;ilin&#8217; my nice silk
coats, I don&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t besmutch myself so not fer
nothin&#8217;. My, but you be a sight! An&#8217; only this
mornin&#8217; &#8217;t ever was you was that lovely!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Take-a-Stitch treated Bonny Angel as she would have treated any
other infant, the result proved her wisdom. As soon as comforting
ceased, the child&#8217;s rebellion to it also ceased; and when,
shocked by its condition, the girl stooped to examine the once dainty
coat, its small wearer scrambled to her feet, lifted her tear-stained
face to be kissed, smiled dazzlingly, and cried merrily, &#8220;Bonny
come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you surely are an &#8216;Angel,&#8217; you beautifullest
thing!&#8221; said Glory, again raising the child in her arms and
starting onward once more. She had no idea whither they were going and
Bonny Angel had ceased to point the way with her tiny forefinger, but
she cuddled her curly head on her nurse&#8217;s shoulder and presently
fell asleep.</p>

<p>The tracks diminished in number as they proceeded till they came to
a point where but few remained. Some ran straight on along the river
bank, though this was hidden by outlying small buildings; and some
branched westward around the bluff whereon grew those green trees and
sloped the terraces seen from the boat. Here, after a halt of
admiration, Glory found it growing exceedingly dark, and wondered if it
had already become nightfall.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems forever an&#8217; ever since we started, but I
didn&#8217;t think &#8217;twas nigh bedtime. An&#8217;, oh, my! Where
will we sleep, an&#8217; shall I ever, ever find my grandpa!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, indeed, nearing the end of the day but it was a mass of
heavy clouds which had so suddenly darkened the world, clouds so black
and threatening that the workmen scattered along the tracks, busy with
pick and shovel, began to throw down their tools and make for the
nearest shelter. One man, with a coat over his head to protect him from
the already falling drops hurried past Glory, where she stood holding
Bonny Angel, and advised:</p>

<p>&#8220;Best not tarry, children, but scud for home. There&#8217;s a
terrible storm coming.&#8221; But he did not stop to see that they
followed his advice nor inquire if any home they had.</p>

<p>Poor Glory&#8217;s heart sank. She was not afraid of any storm for
herself though she had never heard wind roar and wail as this did now,
but how could she bear to have her &#8220;Guardian&#8221; suffer. Even
Meg&#8217;s healthy youngsters sometimes had croup and frightened their
mother &#8220;outen her seventy senses,&#8221; and the croup usually
followed a prolonged playing in flooded gutters during a rain
storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must find a place! Oh, there must be a place somewhere! She
mustn&#8217;t get the croup an&#8217; die on me&#8211;she
mustn&#8217;t. Ain&#8217;t I got to take her to her ma, an&#8217; how
could I tell her I let the baby die? Oh, where?&#8221;</p>

<p>With an agonized glance in every direction and a closer enfolding of
the sleeping child&#8211;over whose head she promptly threw her own
abbreviated skirt&#8211;she discovered, at last, a haven of refuge.</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart! That&#8217;s littler &#8217;an the littlest house, but
it&#8217;s big enough fer us, you sweetest honey darlin&#8217;,
an&#8217; it must ha&#8217; growed a-purpose, all in a minute, just fer
us, like them fairy-lamp-an&#8217;-Aladdin yarns what grandpa used to
tell me! An&#8217; now I know fer true she is a surely &#8216;Guardian
Angel,&#8217; an&#8217; is tooken care of every time, &#8217;cause a minute
ago that littler than the littlest wasn&#8217;t there at all, for I
never saw it an&#8217; I should. An&#8217; now &#8217;tis, an&#8217;
we&#8217;re in it an&#8217;&#8213;Oh, how glad I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>While these thoughts were passing through her mind Glory had been
staggering forward as swiftly as the wind and the burden she carried
would allow and she reached the shelter none too soon. The very instant
she passed within, the rain came down in torrents and the tiny
structure swayed dizzily in the gale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Littler than the littlest&#8221; it was, indeed; only a
railway switchman&#8217;s &#8220;box,&#8221; erected to shelter him in
just such emergencies and from the cold of winter nights. It had tiny
windows and a narrow door; and, placing Bonny Angel on the corner
bench&#8211;its only furnishing&#8211;Take-a-Stitch hastened to make
all secure. The lightning flashed and the thunder rolled, but still and
happily the worn-out &#8220;Guardian&#8221; slept; so that, herself
overcome by fatigue and the closeness of the atmosphere the now vagrant
&#8220;Queen of Elbow Lane&#8221; dropped in a heap on the floor and
also slept.</p>

<p>This switch-box was one but seldom used and nobody came near it till
morning. Then a passing road-hand, on his way to work, fancied it a
good place wherein to eat his breakfast and opened the door. His cry of
surprise at sight of its strange occupants roused them both, and sent
Glory to her feet with an answering cry; while Bonny Angel merely
opened her eyes, stared sleepily around, and smilingly announced:
&#8220;Bonny come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless us, me honey, so you did! But it&#8217;s meself&#8217;d
like to be knowin&#8217; where from an&#8217; how long sence the pair
of ye got your job on the railroad?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was nothing to fear about this man, as Goober Glory saw at
once. His homely face was gay with good health and good nature and the
sunshiny morning after the storm seemed not more sunshiny than he. But
his curiosity was great and he did not rest till it was satisfied by a
full recital of all that had happened to the straying children and
their plans for the future were explained.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face grew grave and he shook his head with
misgiving: &#8220;Lookin&#8217; for a lot of lost people, is it, then?
Hmm. An&#8217;, that may be more&#8217;n of a job than
straightenin&#8217; crooked rails what the storm washed away, as I must
be doin&#8217; to onct. Too big a job to be tacklin&#8217; on empty
stummicks, betoken; so here, the two of yez, fall in an&#8217; taste
this bread an&#8217; meat an&#8217; couple o&#8217; cold spuds,
an&#8217; let me get on to me own affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Opening his tin pail, he made a cup of its inverted top, into which
he poured a lot of cold tea and offered it to Glory, who in turn,
promptly presented it to the now clamorous Bonny, and had the pleasure
of seeing the little one drink deeply before she discovered for herself
that it was not her accustomed milk, and rejected the remainder. Both
the workman and Take-a-Stitch laughed at the little one&#8217;s wry
face, while having divided the bread and meat into three fair portions,
all fell to with a will, so that soon not a crumb was left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that was prime!&#8221; cried Glory, smacking her lips;
&#8220;and you&#8217;re the primest sort of man to give it to us. I
hope I&#8217;ll have something to give you some time,&#8221; she
finished a little wistfully, and keenly regarding various rents in his
clothes. &#8220;If I had my needle an&#8217; thread I might work it
out, maybe. You need mendin&#8217; dreadful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betoken! So I do. An&#8217; be ye a colleen &#8217;at&#8217;s handy
with them sort o&#8217; tools?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I can sew!&#8221; cried Glory, triumphantly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;cause of that the Elbowers call me
&#8216;Mend-a-Hole,&#8217; or &#8216;Take-a-Stitch,&#8217; whichever happens.
Why&#8211;why&#8211;I earn money&#8211;real money&#8211;sewin&#8217;
the Lane folks up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; yet bein&#8217; that mite of a thing ye are!&#8221;
returned this new friend, admiringly. &#8220;Well then, &#8217;tis out
to me sister&#8217;s husband&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s house I&#8217;m
wishin&#8217; ye was this instant. For of all the folks needs the
mendin&#8217; an&#8217; patchin&#8217;, &#8217;tis she, with her seven
own childer, an&#8217; her ten boardin&#8217; &#8216;hands,&#8217; an&#8217;
her own man, that was gardener to some great folks beyant, laid up with
the chills an&#8217; not able to do a hand&#8217;s turn for himself,
barrin&#8217; eatin&#8217; an&#8217; drinkin&#8217; fair, when the
victuals is ready. He can play a good knife an&#8217; fork, still,
thanks be, an&#8217; it&#8217;s hopin&#8217; he&#8217;ll soon be
playin&#8217; his shovel an&#8217; spade just as lively, but
that&#8217;s no more here nor yet there. There&#8217;s miles betwixt
this an&#8217; yon, an&#8217;&#8213;Hello! Aye, hello-a-oa!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sudden break in Timothy Dowd&#8217;s chatter was caused by the
hailing of some fellow workmen who had rumbled up to them a hand-car
over a near-by track and had signaled him to join them.</p>

<p>&#8220;For it&#8217;s not down track but up you&#8217;re to go, Tim,
the washouts bein&#8217; worst beyond. Step aboard, we&#8217;ve to
hustle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Timothy picked up his tools and started to comply, when his glance
fell once more upon the eager face of Goober Glory and pity for her
made him hesitate. Then a bright idea flashed through his brain and he
demanded of the man who had accosted him, &#8220;How fur be ye
goin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the trestle beyond Simpson&#8217;s. Hurry up. Step
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>For only answer, Timothy immediately swung Glory up to the little
platform car, depositing Bonny Angel beside her with equal speed, then
made room for himself among the surprised trackmen already grouped
there. Yet beyond another astonished &#8220;Hello!&#8221; no comment
was made and the hand-car bumped forward again toward its
destination.</p>

<p>However, it wasn&#8217;t Timothy Dowd&#8217;s habit to be silent
when he could find anything to say, so he was presently explaining in
his loud-voiced, jolly way that here was a &#8220;pair o&#8217; angels
that he&#8217;d found floating round in the mud and was goin&#8217; to
bestow &#8217;em where they&#8217;d do the most good. An&#8217;
that&#8217;s to Mary Fogarty&#8217;s, indeed. Her of the sharp tongue
an&#8217; warm heart an&#8217; houseful of creatures, every blessed one
of that same rippin&#8217; off buttons that constant, an&#8217; her
livin&#8217; the very pattern of handiness to Simpson&#8217;s trestle
an&#8217; couldn&#8217;t have been planned no better not if&#8213;Hi,
baby, how goes it?&#8221;</p>

<p>This to Bonny Angel, whose eyes had shone with delight when first
the car had rolled forward, but who now grew frightened and began to
whimper dismally, which set Glory&#8217;s own heart beating sorrowfully
and spoiled her pleasure in this novel ride. Springing up she would
have taken Bonny Angel from Timothy&#8217;s arms into her own had he
not rudely pushed her down again, commanding sternly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Try that no more, colleen, lest ye&#8217;d be after
murderin&#8217; the pair of us! Sit flat, sit flat, girl, an&#8217; cut
no monkey-shines with nobody, a-ridin&#8217; on a hand-car.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory had not thought of danger, though her new friend had not
over-rated it. In obedience to this unexpected sternness, she crouched
motionless beside him, though she firmly clutched at Bonny&#8217;s
skirts and began to think this her hardest experience yet, till after a
time, at sight of a gamboling squirrel, the little one forgot her fear
and laughed out gleefully. Then Glory laughed, too, for already her
tiny &#8220;Guardian&#8221; could influence every mood, so dearly had
she grown to love the child thus thrown upon her care.</p>

<p>How the fences and the fields raced by! How the birds sang and the
flowers bloomed! And how very, very soon the queer little car stopped
short at a skeleton bridge over a noisy creek! There all the workmen
leaped to the ground and hastily prepared for labor. Even Timothy had
no further time to talk but coolly setting the children upon a bank
pointed to a house across the fields and ordered Glory, &#8220;Go there
an&#8217; tell your story, an&#8217; tell Mary Fogarty I sent
ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he fell to his own tasks and Take-a-Stitch had no choice save
obedience.</p>

<p>For a little distance, there was fascination in the meadow for both
small wanderers; but soon Bonny Angel&#8217;s feet lagged and she put
up her arms with that mute pleading to be carried which Glory could not
resist, yet the little creature soon grew intolerably heavy, and her
face buried beneath her nurse&#8217;s chin seemed to burn into the
flesh, the blue eyes closed, the whole plump little body settled limp
and inert, and a swift alarm shot through the other&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, I believe she&#8217;s sick! Do &#8216;Angels&#8217; ever
get sick? But she isn&#8217;t a truly &#8216;Angel,&#8217; I know now.
She&#8217;s just somebody&#8217;s lost baby. Queer! Grandpa so old
an&#8217; she so young should both of &#8217;em get lost to onct,
an&#8217; only me to look out for &#8217;em! Yet, maybe, that Mary
Fogarty woman&#8217;ll help us out. I hope she&#8217;ll be like
Meg-Laundress, or darlin&#8217; Posy Jane. Strange, how long these
fields are. Longer&#8217;n the longest avenue there is an&#8217; not one
single house the hull length. Why ain&#8217;t there houses, I wonder.
Wake up, Bonny precious! We&#8217;re almost there.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when they reached the door of the Queen Anne cottage, which was
intended to be picturesque and had succeeded in being merely extremely
dirty, and out of which swarmed a horde of youngsters each more soiled
than the other, Glory&#8217;s heart sank. For the big woman who
followed the horde was not in the least like either old friend of Elbow
Lane. Her voice was harsh and forbidding as she demanded, &#8220;Well,
an&#8217; who are you; an&#8217; what are you wantin&#8217;
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Timothy sent us,&#8221; answered Glory, meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! He did, did he? Well, he never had sense. Now, into the
house with ye, every born child of ye!&#8221; she rejoined,
indifferently, and &#8220;shooed&#8221; her own brood, like a flock of
chickens, back into the cottage, then slammed its door in the
visitor&#8217;s face.</p>

<h2><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A Haven of Refuge</span></h2>

<p>Glory&#8217;s walk and heavy burden had exhausted her and, almost
unconsciously, she let Bonny Angel slip from her arms to the door-step
where she stood. There the child lay, flushed and motionless, in a
sleep which nothing disturbed, though hitherto she had wakened at any
call. Now, though in remorse at her own carelessness, Take-a-Stitch
bent over the little one and begged her pardon most earnestly, the baby
gave no sign of hearing and slumbered on with her face growing a deeper
red and her breath beginning to come in a way that recalled the old
captain&#8217;s snores.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do now?&#8221; cried poor Glory, aloud, looking
around over the wide country, so unlike the crowded Lane, and seeing no
shelter anywhere at which she dared again apply. Some buildings there
were, behind and removed from the cottage; but they were so like that
inhospitable structure in color and design that she felt their
indwellers would also be the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I hadn&#8217;t come all that way over the
grass,&#8221; said poor Glory. &#8220;If we&#8217;d stayed by them
car-rails, likely we&#8217;d have come somewhere that there was
houses&#8211;different. And, Bonny Angel, sweetest, preciousest,
darlingest one, do please, please, wake up and walk yourself just a
little, teeny, tiny bit. Then, when I get rested a mite, I&#8217;ll
carry you again, &#8217;cause we&#8217;ve got to go, you see. That Timothy
was mistook an&#8217; his sister&#8217;s husband&#8217;s cousin
won&#8217;t let us in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet even while her back was toward it, as she contemplated the
landscape pondering which way lay her road, the door again suddenly
opened and Mary Fogarty announced, shrilly, but not unkindly:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the wagon-house. You can rest there a spell,
seein&#8217; you was simple enough to lug that hefty young one clear
across the meadder. It&#8217;s that third one, where the big door
stands open an&#8217; the stone-boat is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory faced about, her face at once radiant with gratitude, and its
effect upon the cottage mistress was to further soften her asperity, so
that though she again ejaculated that contemptuous &#8220;Huh!&#8221;
it was in a milder tone; and, with something like interest she
demanded, &#8220;How long &#8217;s that baby been that feverish she is
now? She looks &#8217;s if she was comin&#8217; down with
somethin&#8217; catchin&#8217;. Best get her home, soon &#8217;s you
can, sissy. She ain&#8217;t fit to be runnin&#8217; round
loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor little Bonny Angel didn&#8217;t look much like &#8220;running
loose&#8221; at present, and as for &#8220;home,&#8221; the word
brought an intolerable feeling to Glory&#8217;s heart, making the sunny
fields before her to seem like prison walls that yet had a curious sort
of wobble to them, as if they were dancing up and down in a wild way.
But that was because she regarded them now through a mist of tears she
could not repress, while visions of a shadowy Lane, whose very gloom
would have been precious to her on that hot day, obtruded themselves
upon the scene.</p>

<p>With a desperate desire for guidance, Glory burst out her whole
story and Mary Fogarty was forced to listen, whether or no. To that
good woman&#8217;s credit it was that as she listened her really warm
heart, upon which Timothy Dowd had counted, got the better of her
impatience and, once more closing the door upon her peeping children,
she said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you poor, brave little creatur&#8217;! Come this way.
I&#8217;ll show you where, though you must carry the baby yourself, if
so be she won&#8217;t carry herself. I&#8217;ve got seven o&#8217; my
own an&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t have nothin&#8217; catchin&#8217; get
amongst them, not for a fortune. I wouldn&#8217;t dare. I&#8217;ve had
&#8217;em down, four er five to a time, with whooping-cough an&#8217;
measles an&#8217; scarletina an&#8217; what not; an&#8217; now sence
the twinses come, I don&#8217;t want no more of it I can tell you.
Don&#8217;t lag.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary strode along, &#8220;like a horse,&#8221; as her husband
frequently complimented her, walking as fast as she was talking and,
with Bonny Angel in her arms, Goober Glory did her best to keep a
similar pace. But this was impossible. Not only were her feet heavy
beneath the burden she bore, but her heart ached with foreboding. With
Bonny Angel ill, how was the search for grandpa to go on? How to look
for the little one&#8217;s own people? Yet how terrible that they must
be left in their grief while she could do nothing to comfort them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if they only knew! She&#8217;s so safe with me, I love
her so. If I could only tell them! I wonder&#8211;I wonder who they are
and where they are and shall I ever, ever find them!&#8221; she
exclaimed in her anxiety as, coming to the wagon-house door, she found
Mistress Fogarty awaiting her.</p>

<p>That lady answered with her own cheerful exclamation, &#8220;&#8217;Course
you will. Everything comes right, everywhere, give it time enough. Now
step right up into this loft. There&#8217;s a bed here that the extry
man sleeps on when there is an extry. None now. Real gardenin&#8217;
comes to a standstill when Dennis has the chills. You can put the baby
down there an&#8217; let her sleep her sleep out. You might &#8217;s
well lie down yourself and take a snooze, bein&#8217; you&#8217;re that
petered out a luggin&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get back an&#8217; start up dinner,&#8221; continued
Mary. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big job, even with Dennis round to peel and
watch the fryin&#8217;. Seven youngsters of my own, with him an&#8217;
me, and ten boarders&#8213;My, it takes a pile of bread to keep all
them mouths full, let alone pies an&#8217; fixin&#8217;s. It&#8217;s
vegetable soup to-day, and as the gang&#8217;s working right nigh,
they&#8217;ll all be in prompt. I won&#8217;t forget ye, an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll send something out to ye by somebody&#8211;but don&#8217;t
you pay me back by giving one of my children anything
catchin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Glory could assure the anxious mother that she would do her
utmost for their safety, Mary had run down the rude stairs, shaking the
shed-like building as she ran, and was within the red cottage ere the
visitor realized it.</p>

<p>Glory exclaimed, as she gazed about, &#8220;Here we are, at last, in
a regular house! And my, isn&#8217;t it big? Why, ever an&#8217; ever
so much bigger than the &#8216;littlest house in Ne&#8217; York!&#8217; That
bed&#8217;s wide enough for all Meg&#8217;s children to onct,
and&#8211;my, how Bonny Angel does sleep. I&#8217;m sleepy, too, now I
see such a prime place. The woman told me to sleep and I guess
I&#8217;d better mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, presently, having removed Bonny&#8217;s draggled coat from the
still drowsy child, Glory placed her charge at the extreme back of the
bed and lay down herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, sissy! Come down an&#8217; get your basin of soup.
Enough in it for the pair of ye, with strawberry shortcake to
match!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this summons which aroused Glory from a delightful slumber
and she sprang to her feet, not comprehending, at first, what she heard
or where she was. Then she returned, laughing as she spoke,
&#8220;&#8217;Course I&#8217;ll come, you splendid Mary Fogarty! And
I&#8217;m more obliged &#8217;an I can say, but I&#8217;ll work it out, I
truly will try to work it out, if you&#8217;ll hunt up your jobs. That
dear Timothy said you needed mendin&#8217;, dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was unaware that this same Timothy was also close at
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he did, did he? Well, he said the true word for once, but
bad manners in him all the same,&#8221; answered Mrs. Fogarty; and, as
Glory joined them at the foot of the stairs, there were the two engaged
in a sort of scuffle which had more mirth than malice in it.</p>

<p>When Take-a-Stitch appeared, they regarded her with a look of
compassion which she did not understand; because at the dinner, now
comfortably over, the child and her hopeless search had been discussed
and the ten boarders, the seven children, with their parents, had all
reached one and the same conclusion, namely, that the only safe place
for such innocent and ignorant vagrants was in some
&#8220;Asylum.&#8221; Who was to announce this decision and convey the
little ones to their place of refuge had not, as yet, been settled.
Nobody was inclined to take up that piece of work and the ten boarders
sauntered back to their more congenial labor on the railroad, leaving
the matter in Mary Fogarty&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>However, it was a matter destined for nobody to settle, because when
Glory had carefully conveyed the basin of soup, the pitcher of milk and
the generous slices of shortcake back to the loft, she was frightened
out of all hunger by the appearance of Bonny Angel. It was almost the
first time in her life that the little &#8220;Queen of Elbow
Lane&#8221; had had a dinner set before her of such proper quantity and
quality, yet she was not to taste it.</p>

<p>Bonny was tossing to and fro, sometimes moaning with pain, sometimes
shrieking in terror, but always in such a state as to banish every
thought save of herself from Glory&#8217;s mind. And then began a week
of the greatest anxiety and distress which even the little caretaker of
Elbow Lane, with her self-imposed charge of its many children, had ever
known.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she should die before I find her folks! If it&#8217;s
&#8217;cause I haven&#8217;t done the best I could for her&#8213;Oh, what
shall I do!&#8221; wailed Take-a-Stitch, herself grown haggard with
watching and grief, so that she looked like any other than the winsome
child who had flashed upon Miss Bonnicastle&#8217;s vision at that
memorable visit of hers to that crooked little alley where they had
met.</p>

<p>And Timothy Dowd, the only one of the big household near, whom Mary
Fogarty permitted to enter the wagon-house-hospital, sighed as he
answered with an affected cheerfulness: &#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s nobody
dies around these parts; not a body since I was put to work on this
section the road. So, why more her nor another an&#8217; she the
youngest o&#8217; the lot? Younger, betoken, nor the twinses
theirselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; it&#8217;s naught but that crotchetty woman,
yon,&#8221; continued Tim, &#8220;that&#8217;s cousin to me own
sister&#8217;s husband, &#8217;d have took such fool notions into her
head. Forbiddin&#8217; me, even me, her own relation by marriage, to
set foot inside her door till she says the word, an&#8217; somebody
tellin&#8217; her we should be smoked out with sulphur an&#8217;
brimstone, like rats in a hole, ere ever we can mix with decent folks
again. An&#8217; some of the boys, even, takin&#8217; that nonsense
from herself, an&#8217; not likin&#8217; to dig in the same ditch along
with the contagious Tim. Sure, it&#8217;s contagious an&#8217;
cantankerous and all them other big things we&#8217;ll be, when we get
out o&#8217; this an&#8217; find the old captain, your grandpa,
an&#8217; the biggest kind of a celebration &#8217;twill be, or never
saw I the blue skies of old Ireland! Bless the sod!&#8221;</p>

<p>But in his heart, faithful Timothy did not look for Bonny
Angel&#8217;s recovery. Nobody knew what ailed her, since physician had
not been called. Against such professional advice, Mary Fogarty had set
her big foot with an unmovable firmness. Doctors had never interfered
in her household save once, when Dennis, misguided man, had consulted
one. And witness, everybody, hadn&#8217;t he been sick and useless ever
since?</p>

<p>So, from a safe distance, she assumed charge of the case; sending
Glory a pair of shears with which to shave Bonny&#8217;s sunny head,
directing that all windows should be closed, lest the little patient
&#8220;take cold,&#8221; and preparing food suitable for the hardest
working &#8220;boarder,&#8221; rather than the delicate stomach of a
sick child.</p>

<p>However, had they known it, there was nothing whatever infectious
about little Bonny&#8217;s illness, which was simply the result of
unaccustomed exposure and unwholesome food; nor did good Mary&#8217;s
unwise directions cause any great harm, because, though a delicate
child, the baby was a healthy one. She had no desire for the coarse
food that was offered her but drank frequently of the milk that
accompanied it; and as for the matter of fresh air, although Glory had
to keep the windows closed, there was plenty of ventilation from the
wide apertures under the eaves of the shed.</p>

<p>At the end of the week, the devoted young nurse had the delight of
hearing her &#8220;Angel&#8221; laugh outright, for the first time in
so many days, and to feel her darling&#8217;s arms about her own neck
while the pale little lips cried out once more the familiar,
&#8220;Bonny come! Bonny come!&#8221;</p>

<p>To catch her tiny &#8220;Guardian&#8221; up and run with her to the
cottage-door took but a minute, but there Glory&#8217;s enthusiasm was
promptly dashed by Mary&#8217;s appearance. Shaking her arms
vigorously, she &#8220;shooed&#8221; the pair away, as she
&#8220;shooed&#8221; everything objectionable out of her path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand back! Stand back, the two of ye! Don&#8217;t dast to
come anigh, sence the time of gettin&#8217; over things is the very
worst time to give &#8217;em. Hurry back to the wagon-house, quick,
quick! And once you&#8217;re safe inside, I&#8217;ll fetch you some
other clothes that you must both put on. Every stitch you&#8217;ve
wore, ary one, and the bedclothes, has got to be burnt. Tim&#8217;s to
burn &#8217;em this noonin&#8217;. I&#8217;ve got no girl your size,
but that don&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;ve cut off an old skirt o&#8217;
my own, for your outside, an&#8217; little Joe&#8217;s your very
pattern for shape, so his shirt an&#8217; blouse &#8217;ll do
amazin&#8217; well. As for the baby, she can put on a suit of the
twinses&#8217; till so be we can do better. Now hurry up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory could not help lingering for a moment to ask, &#8220;Must it
be burned? Do you really, truly, mean to burn Bonny Angel&#8217;s
lovely white silk coat, an&#8217; her pretty dress all lace an&#8217;
trimmin&#8217;? An&#8217; my blue frock&#8211;why, I haven&#8217;t wore
it but two years, that an&#8217; the other one to home. It&#8217;s as
good as good, only lettin&#8217; out tucks now and then
an&#8217;&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! S&#8217;pose you, a little girl, know more about what&#8217;s
right than I do, a big growed up woman? I&#8217;ve took you in
an&#8217; done for ye all this time an&#8217; the least you can do is
to do as you&#8217;re told,&#8221; replied Mrs. Fogarty, in her
sharpest manner.</p>

<p>Thus reprimanded, Glory retreated to the wagon-house, whence, after
a time, she reappeared so altered by her new attire that she scarcely
knew herself. Much less, did she think, that any old friend of Elbow
Lane would recognize her. She was next directed to carry all the
discarded clothing and bedding to a certain spot in the barnyard, where
Timothy would make a bonfire of it as soon as he appeared; and her
heart ached to part with the silken coat which had enwrapped her
precious &#8220;Guardian,&#8221; even though it were now soiled and
most disreputable.</p>

<p>However, these were minor troubles. The joyful fact remained that
Bonny Angel had not died but was already recovered and seemed more like
her own gay little self with every passing moment. Clothes didn&#8217;t
matter, even if they were those of a boy. They needed considerable
hitching up and pinning, for they were as minus of buttons as all the
garments seemed to be which had to pass through Mary Fogarty&#8217;s
hands and washtub; but a few strings would help and maybe Timothy Dowd
could supply those; and if once Take-a-Stitch could get her fingers
upon a needle and thread&#8211;my, how she would alter everything!</p>

<p>Summoned back to the cottage, after she had fulfilled her
hostess&#8217;s last demand, Glory&#8217;s spirits rose to the highest.
It was the first time she had entered the ranks of the seven other
children which filled it to overflowing, and who were
&#8220;shooed&#8221; into or out of it, according to their
mother&#8217;s whim.</p>

<p>It happened to be out, just then, and with the throng Glory, fast
holding Bonny in her arms, chanced to pass close beside the shivering
Dennis in his seat by the stove. He looked at her curiously but kindly,
and his gaze moved from her now happy face to that of the child in her
clasp, where it rested with such a fixed yet startled expression that
Glory exclaimed, &#8220;Oh, sir, what is it? Do you see anything wrong
with my precious?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it was the fact that Dennis Fogarty spoke as seldom as his wife
did often; and that when he was most profoundly moved he spoke not at
all. So then, though his eyes kept their astonished, perplexed
expression, his lips closed firmly and to Glory&#8217;s anxious
inquiry, he made no reply.</p>

<p>Therefore, waiting but a moment longer, she hurried after the other
children and in five minutes was leading them at their games just as
she had always led the Elbow children in theirs. But Bonny was still
too weak and too small to keep up very long with the boisterous play of
these new mates, and seeing this, Take-a-Stitch presently made the
seven group themselves around her on the grass while she told them
tales.</p>

<p>Glory thought of all the fairy stories with which the old blind
captain had beguiled their darkened evenings in that &#8220;littlest
house&#8221; where gas or lamplight could not be afforded; then she
went on to real stories of the Elbow children themselves; of
Meg-Laundress and Posy Jane; and most of all of Nick and Billy, her
chosen comrades and almost brothers. One and all the young Fogartys
listened open-mouthed and delighted; but, when pressed to talk more
about that &#8220;grandpa you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for,&#8221; poor
Glory grew silent.</p>

<p>It was one of the loveliest spots in the world where Glory sat that
morning, with its view of field and mountain and the wonderful river
winding placidly between; but the outcast child would have exchanged it
all for just one glimpse of a squalid alley, and a tiny familiar
doorway, wherein an old seaman should be sitting carving a bit of
wood.</p>

<p>Thinking of him, though not talking, she became less interesting
company to the Fogartys, who withdrew one by one, attracted by the odor
of dinner preparing, and hungry for the scraps which would be tossed
among them by their indulgent mother.</p>

<p>Bonny Angel went to sleep; and, holding her snugly, Glory herself
leaned back against the tree trunk where she was sitting and closed her
own eyes. She did this the better to mature her plans for the search
she meant to resume that very day, if possible, and certainly by the
morrow at the latest. Now that Bonny was so nearly well, she must go
on; and as her head whirled with the thoughts which swarmed it, it
seemed to her that she had &#8220;grown as old as old since grandpa
went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glory at last decided that she had best stop thinking and planning
altogether, just for a moment, and go to sleep as Bonny Angel had done.
She remembered that grandpa had often said that a nap of &#8220;forty
winks&#8221; would clear his own head and set him up lively for the
rest of the day. Whatever Captain Simon Beck, in his great wisdom said
was right, must be so; and though it seemed very lazy for a big girl
such as she to take &#8220;forty winks&#8221; on her own account and in
the daytime, she did take them and with so many repetitions of the
&#8220;forty&#8221; that the boarders had all come home across the
fields before she roused again to know what was going on about her.</p>

<p>There was a hum of voices on the other side of the tree; and though
they were low, as if not intended for her ear, they were also very
earnest and in evident dispute over some subject which she gradually
learned was none other than herself.</p>

<p>She had been going to call out to them, cheerily, but what she heard
made her sit up and listen closely. Not very honorable, it may be, yet
wholly natural, since Mistress Mary was insisting:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use talkin&#8217;, Timothy Dowd, them two
must pack to the first &#8216;Asylum&#8217; will take &#8217;em in. The
sooner the better and this very day the best of all. &#8217;Twas yourself
brought &#8217;em or sent &#8217;em, and &#8217;tis yourself must do
the job. You can knock off work this half-day and get it
settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but Mary, me cousin, by marriage that is. I hate it. I
hate it worse nor ever was. Sure, it was bad enough touchin&#8217; a
match to them neat little clothes o&#8217; theirs but forcin&#8217;
themselves away&#8213;Ah! Mary, mother o&#8217; seven, think! What if
&#8217;twas one o&#8217; your own, now?&#8221; wheedled Tim.</p>

<p>But Mary was not to be moved. Indeed, she dared not be. As Glory had
already learned, Dennis Fogarty was the now useless gardener of the
rich family which lived in the great house on the hill beyond, and to
whom the abused Queen Anne cottage and all the other red outbuildings
visible belonged.</p>

<p>The rich people were very particular to have all things on their
estate kept in perfect order; and though they had no fault to find with
Dennis himself, whenever he was well enough to work, they did find much
fault with his shiftless or careless wife, while the brood of noisy
children was a constant annoyance to them, whenever they occupied
Broadacres.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that during the family&#8217;s stay at the
great house, Mary so seldom allowed her children out of the house; nor
had Dennis ever permitted her to visit the place in person when there
was any chance of her being seen by his employers. He felt that he held
his own position merely by their generosity; nor did he approve of her
boarding the workmen of the near-by railway. Still, he knew that his
children must be fed, and, without the money she earned, how could they
be?</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s argument, then, against taking into her home two more
children, to make bad matters worse, was a good one, and Timothy could
find no real word to say against it. Yet he was all in sympathy with
Glory&#8217;s search for the missing seaman, and how could he be the
instrument of shutting her up in any institution, no matter how good,
where she could not continue that search?</p>

<p>Having heard thus much, and recalling even then Posy Jane&#8217;s
saying about &#8220;listeners hearin&#8217; no good o&#8217;
theirselves,&#8221; Take-a-Stitch quietly rose and went around the tree
till she stood before her troubled friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought you was asleep!&#8221; cried poor Timothy,
rather awkwardly and very red in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I was, part of the time. Part I wasn&#8217;t and I
listened. I shouldn&#8217;t ought, I know, an&#8217; grandpa would say
so, but I&#8217;m glad I did, &#8217;cause you needn&#8217;t worry no more
&#8217;bout Bonny Angel an&#8217; me. I will start right off. I was
going to, to-morrow, anyway, if she didn&#8217;t get sick again;
an&#8217; Mis&#8217; Fogarty will have to leave us these clothes
till&#8211;till&#8211;I can some time&#8211;some day&#8211;maybe earn
some for myself. Then I&#8217;ll get &#8217;em sent back, somehow,
an&#8217;&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time, Mary was also upon her feet, tearful and compassionate
and fain to turn her eyes away from the sad, brave little face that
confronted her. Yet not even her pity could fathom the longing of this
vagrant &#8220;Queen&#8221; for her dirty Lane and her loyal subjects;
nor how she shrank in terror from the lonely search she knew she must
yet continue, thinking, &#8220;&#8217;Cause grandpa would never have give me
up if I was lost and I never will him, never, never, never! But if only
Billy, er Nick, er&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fogarty interrupted the little girl&#8217;s thoughts with the
remark, &#8220;Now them &#8216;Asylums&#8217; is just beautiful, honey
darlin&#8217;&#8211;an&#8217; you&#8217;ll be as happy as the day is
long. You&#8217;ll&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Glory&#8217;s turn to interrupt the cooing voice, which,
indeed, she had scarcely heard, because of another sound which had come
to her ear; and it was now a countenance glorified in truth by
unlooked-for happiness that they saw, as with uplifted hand and parted
lips, she strove to catch the distant strains of music which seemed
sent to check her grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! Hark! Listen! Sh-h-h!&#8221; cried the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless us, colleen! Have ye lost your seventy senses,
laughin&#8217; an&#8217; cryin&#8217; to onct, like a daft
creatur&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Timothy, amazed.</p>

<p>She did not stop to answer him but gently placing Bonny Angel in his
arms, sped away down the road, crying ecstatically, &#8220;Luigi!
Luigi!&#8221;</p>

<h2><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>News From The Lane</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Hmm, hmm, indeed! An&#8217; what is &#8216;Loo-ee-gy&#8217; anyhow?
An&#8217; what is the noise I hear save one them wore-out
hurdy-gurdies, that do be roamin&#8217; the country over, soon&#8217;s
ever the town gets too hot to hold &#8217;em? Wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;pear that
a nice spoken little girl as yon would be takin&#8217; up with no
Eyetalian organ-grinder,&#8221; grumbled Timothy, a trifle jealously.
Already he felt a sort of proprietorship in Glory and the
&#8220;Angel&#8221; and had revolved in his mind for several
nights&#8211;that is when he could keep awake&#8211;what he could do to
help her. He was as reluctant to place her in any institution against
her will as she was to have him, but he had not known what else to
propose to Mary&#8217;s common sense suggestion.</p>

<p>Both Timothy and Mrs. Fogarty watched the open gateway, through
which Take-a-Stitch had vanished, for her to reappear, since the brick
wall at the foot of the slope fully hid the road beyond.</p>

<p>The music had soon ceased, but not until all the seven had swarmed
out of the house, excited over even so trifling a &#8220;show&#8221; to
break the monotony of their lives. All seven now began to exercise
themselves in the wildest antics, leaping over one another&#8217;s
shoulders, turning somersaults, each fisticuffing his neighbor, and
finally emitting a series of deafening whoops as Glory actually turned
back into the grounds, her hands clinging to the arm of a swarthy
little man, who carried a hand-organ on his back and a monkey on his
shoulder. The hand-organ was of the poorest type and the monkey looked
as though he had been &#8220;upon the road&#8221; for many, many
years&#8211;so ancient and wrinkled was his visage. His jaunty red coat
had faded from its original tint to a dirty brown; and the funny little
cap which he pulled from his head was full of holes, so that it was a
wonder he did not lose from it the few cents he was able to collect in
it for his master.</p>

<p>But the vagrant pair might have been some wonderful grandees, so
proudly did Goober Glory convey them up the slope to the very tree
where Mary and her brood awaited them, crying joyfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Luigi! Luigi Salvatore, Antonio&#8217;s brother! He
knows me, he knows us all and he&#8217;s come straight from Elbow Lane.
I mean, quite straight, &#8217;cause he was there after I was. Wasn&#8217;t
you, Luigi?&#8221;</p>

<p>Luigi stood bareheaded now, resting his organ-pole upon the ground
and glancing from Glory&#8217;s eager face to the curious faces of
these others. He understood but little of &#8220;United States
language,&#8221; having come to that country but a short time before,
and having hitherto relied upon his brother Toni to interpret for him
when necessary. He was waiting permission to grind out his next tune,
and not as surprised as Timothy was that the little girl should have
recognized his organ from a multitude of others, which to the
railroader sounded exactly the same.</p>

<p>Take-a-Stitch nodded her head, also freshly cropped like
Bonny&#8217;s, and he began. For a time all went well. The seven young
Fogartys were in ecstasies, and even their elders beamed with delight,
forgetting that the one would be &#8220;docked&#8221; for his wasted
time and the other that the cat and her kittens were at that moment
helping to &#8220;clear the table&#8221; she had left standing. Even
Bonny Angel gravely nodded approval from her perch in Timothy&#8217;s
arms, save when the too solicitous monkey held his cap to her. Then she
frowned and buried her pretty face on Timothy&#8217;s shoulder and
raised it only when Jocko had hopped another way.</p>

<p>But suddenly out of his selections, Luigi began that ancient tune,
&#8220;A Life on the Ocean Wave, A Home on the Rolling
Deep&#8221;&#8211;and then disaster!</p>

<p>Almost as distinctly as if he stood there before her in the flesh,
forsaken Glory saw her grandfather&#8217;s beloved form; clad in his
well-kept old uniform, buttons shining, head thrown back, gilt-trimmed
cap held easily in his wrinkled hand, with Bos&#8217;n sitting gravely
upright beside him. There he stood, in her fancy; and the vision
well-nigh broke her heart. Then down upon the grass she flung herself
and all her brave self-repression gave way before the flood of homesick
longing which besieged her.</p>

<p>Nobody quite understood what ailed her, though from having heard the
captain sing that melody he had just ground out, Luigi dimly guessed.
But the effect upon all was that there had been quite music enough for
the time being, and Mary showed her wisdom by drawing the company away,
counseling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her have her cry out. She&#8217;s kep&#8217; in brave
an&#8217; &#8217;twill do her good. More good&#8217;n a lickin&#8217;!&#8221;
she finished, with a lunge at her eldest son, who was fast changing his
playful cuffs of a twin into blows which were not playful; and all
because between Jocko and that twin was already developing considerable
interest, which the bigger boy wished to fix upon himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, ma! What for? &#8217;Tain&#8217;t every day a monkey
comes a visitin&#8217; here an&#8217; he&#8217;s had him long enough.
My turn next, an&#8217; that&#8217;s fair,&#8221; protested Dennis,
junior, namesake of the gardener.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more it isn&#8217;t, an&#8217; me forgettin&#8217; my
manners after the fine music he&#8217;s give us. Look up, Glory,
an&#8217; ask the gentleman, Looeegy yon, would he like a bite to
eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl raised her face, already ashamed of crying before other
people, and instantly eager to do something for this visitor from
&#8220;home&#8221;; and when she had repeated Mary&#8217;s invitation
to Luigi the smiles came back to her own face at the smiles which
lightened his.</p>

<p>Alas! It wasn&#8217;t very much of the good dinner was left, after
the cat and her kittens had done with it, but such as remained was most
welcome to the poor Italian. Accustomed to a dry loaf of bread washed
down with water from the roadside, even the remnants of Mary
Fogarty&#8217;s food seemed a feast to him; and he enjoyed it upon the
door-step with Glory at his feet and Jocko coming in for whatever
portion his master thought best to spare.</p>

<p>Afterward, comforted and rested, he would have repaid his hostess by
another round of his melodies; but this, much to the disgust of seven
small lads, Take-a-Stitch prevented.</p>

<p>Leading the organ-grinder from the threshold of the cottage to the
tree beyond it, Glory made Luigi sit down again and answer every
question she put to him; and though he did not always comprehend her
words, he did her gestures, so that, soon, she had learned all he knew
of the Lane since she had left it until the previous day when he had
done so.</p>

<p>First, because to him it seemed of the greater importance, Luigi
dwelt upon Toni&#8217;s disappointment, and divulged the great
&#8220;secret&#8221; which had matured in the peanut-merchant&#8217;s
brain, and was to have been made known to Goober Glory, had she not
&#8220;runned the way.&#8221; The secret was a scheme for the
betterment of everybody concerned and of Antonio Salvatore in especial;
and to the effect that the blind captain and Goober Glory should form a
partnership. She was to be given charge of Antonio&#8217;s own big
stand; while comfortable upon a high stool, beside it, the captain was
to sit and sing. This would have attracted many customers, Toni
thought, by its novelty; and, incidentally, the seaman might sell some
of his own frames. As for the proprietor himself, he was to have taken
and greatly enlarged the &#8220;outside business&#8221;; Luigi
assisting him whenever the organ failed to pay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money, little one! Oh, mucha money for all! But you stole the
baby and runned away,&#8221; ended this part of the stroller&#8217;s
tale, as she interpreted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never! Never, never, never! She was sent! She belongs. Hear
me!&#8221; cried Glory, indignantly, and forthwith poured into
Luigi&#8217;s puzzled ear all her own story. Then she demanded that he
should answer over again her first question when she had met him;
hoping a different reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has my grandpa come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Luigi only shook his head. Even through his dim understanding,
there had filtered the knowledge that the fine old captain never would
so come. He had been killed, crushed, put out of this sunny world by a
cruel accident. So Antonio had told him; but so, in pity, for her he
would not repeat. Rather he would make light of the matter, and did so,
shrugging his shoulders in his foreign fashion and elevating his
eyebrows indifferently; then conveyed to her in his broken English that
the seaman must have &#8220;moved,&#8221; because the landlord had come
and sent all the furnishings of the &#8220;littlest house&#8221; to the
grocer&#8217;s for safe keeping; and there she would find them when she
wished.</p>

<p>As for Billy Buttons and Nick, his chum, they were as bad as ever;
and Posy Jane had never a penny for his music, never; though
Meg-Laundress would sometimes toss him one if he would play for a long,
long time and so keep her children amused and out of mischief. She,
too, had even gone so far as to bid him look out all along the road he
should travel for Goober Glory herself; and if he found her and brought
her back, why she would make him a fine present. Goober Glory had been
the most inexpensive and faithful of nurses to Meg&#8217;s children and
she could afford to do the handsome thing by any one who would restore
her services.</p>

<p>&#8220;And here I find you, already,&#8221; said Luigi, accepting
the wonderful fact as if it were the simplest thing in the world,
whereas, out of the many roads by which he might have journeyed from
the city, this was the one least likely to attract his wandering
footsteps. And this strange thing was, afterward, to confirm good
Meg-Laundress in her faith in &#8220;Guardian Angels.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when he proposed that they return at once to the Lane lest
Meg&#8217;s promise should be forgotten and he defrauded of his
present, Glory firmly objected:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Luigi. I must find grandpa. I must find this
baby&#8217;s folks. Then we will go back, you and me and all of us but
her; &#8217;cause then I&#8217;ll have to give her up, I reckon&#8211;the
darlin&#8217;, preciousest thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Luigi glanced at the sun, at the landscape, at the group of watchful
Fogartys, and reflected that there was no money to be made there. The
hand-organ belonged to Tonio, his brother, and the monkey likewise.
Tonio loved money better than anything; and Luigi, the organ, and the
monkey had been sent forth to collect it, not to loiter by the way; and
if he was not to return at once and secure Meg&#8217;s present, that
would have been appropriated by Antonio, as a matter of course, he must
be about his business. When he had slowly arrived at this decision, he
rose, shouldered the hurdy-gurdy, signaled Jocko to his wrist, pulled
his cap in respect to his hostess, and set off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, wait, Luigi! just one little minute! I must bid them
good-bye, &#8217;cause they&#8217;ve been so good to me, and I&#8217;m going
with you! Just one little bit or minute!&#8221; cried Glory, clasping
his arm, imploringly.</p>

<p>The organ-grinder would be glad of her company, of any company, in
fact; so he waited unquestioningly, while Glory explained, insisted,
and finally overcame the expostulations of Timothy and Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she must go. Not until she had looked forever and ever
could she be shut up in a &#8216;&#8217;sylum&#8217; where she could look no
further. When she found him, they would come back, he and she, and show
them how right she was to keep on and how splendid he was. She thanked
them&#8211;my, how she did thank them for their kindness, and, besides,
there was Bonny Angel. If she&#8217;d dared to give up lookin&#8217;
for grandpa, as he wouldn&#8217;t have give up lookin&#8217; for her,
she must, she must, find the Angel&#8217;s folks. She couldn&#8217;t
rest&#8211;nohow, never. Think o&#8217; all them broken hearts,
who&#8217;d lost such a beau-tiful darlin&#8217; as her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she added, with many a loving look over the whole group,
&#8220;But I mustn&#8217;t keep poor Luigi. He belongs to Toni, seems
if, an&#8217; Toni Salvatore can make it lively for them &#8217;at
don&#8217;t please him. So, good-bye, good-bye&#8211;everybody. Every
single dear good body!&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning, with Bonny Angel once more in her own arms, walking
backward to have the very last glimpse possible of these new friends,
with eyes fast filling again, and stumbling over her long skirt that
had lost its last hook, Glory Beck resumed her seemingly hopeless
search.</p>

<p>However, she was not to depart just yet nor thus. To the surprise of
all, Dennis himself now appeared in the doorway and held up his hand to
detain her. Until then, he had showed but slight interest in her, and
his strange staring at Bonny had been unnoticed by his wife. Now his
face wore a puzzled expression and he passed his hand across his eyes
as if he wished to clear his sight. He gazed with intensity upon
Glory&#8217;s &#8220;Guardian&#8221; once more, and at last
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pease in a pod. &#8217;Tother had yellow curls. Awful trouble for
them, plenty as kids are the country over. Pease in a pod. Might try
it;&#8221; and turning sidewise he pointed toward the distant great
house on the hill. Then he retreated to his fireside again, and Mary
was left to interpret. She did so, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sayin&#8217; the &#8216;family&#8217; &#8217;s in some
sort o&#8217; trouble, though I hadn&#8217;t heard it. Though, &#8217;course,
they&#8217;ve been home only a few days an&#8217; whatever any the
other hands what&#8217;s been down to see him sence has told him he
hain&#8217;t told me. But I make out &#8217;t he thinks Looeegy&#8217;s
playin&#8217; up there on the terrace might do noh arm an&#8217;ll
likely cheer &#8217;em up a mite. That&#8217;s what I make out Dennis
means. You an&#8217; the organ-man&#8217;d best make your first stop
along the road up to the big house. If they won&#8217;t pay anything to
hear him play, likely they will to have him go away, bein&#8217;s
they&#8217;re dreadful scared of tramps an&#8217; such. Good-bye. Come
an&#8217; see us when you can!&#8221;</p>

<h2><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>The Wonderful Ending</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Sure, and it&#8217;s not meself can tackle the road, the day.
As well be &#8216;docked&#8217; for the end as the beginnin&#8217;, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m minded to keep that lot company a piece,&#8221; remarked
Timothy Dowd, to his sister&#8217;s husband&#8217;s cousin. &#8220;That
monkey is most interestin&#8217;, most interestin&#8217; an&#8217;
improvin&#8217;; an&#8217; &#8217;tisn&#8217;t often a lad from old Ireland
has the chance to get acquaintance of the sort, leave alone that Glory
girl, what&#8217;s took up quarters in me heart an&#8217; won&#8217;t
be boosted thence, whatever. The poor little colleen! A-lookin&#8217;
for one lost old man out of a world full! Bless her innocent soul! Yes.
I&#8217;ve a mind to company them a bit. What say, Mary,
woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What need to say a word, sence when a man&#8217;s bent to do
a thing he does it? But keep an open ear, Timothy, boy. I&#8217;m
curious to know what sort o&#8217; trouble &#8217;tis, Dennis hints at,
as comin&#8217; to them old people yon. And he&#8217;d never say,
considerin&#8217; as he does, that what goes on in the big house is no
consarn o&#8217; the cottage, an&#8217; fearin&#8217; to remind
&#8217;em even&#8217;t we&#8217;re alive, lest they pack us off
an&#8217; fetch in folks with no childer to bless an&#8217; bother
&#8217;em. Yes, go, Timothy; and wait; here&#8217;s one them handy
catch-pins, that Glory might tighten her skirt a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Timothy&#8217;s usually merry face had been sadly overclouded as he
watched the departure of Glory and her companions, but it lightened
instantly when Mary favored his suggestion to follow and learn their
fortune. With his hat on the back of his head, his stick over his
shoulder, and his unlighted pipe in his mouth&#8211;which still managed
to whistle a gay tune despite this impediment&#8211;he sauntered along
the road in the direction the others had taken, though at some distance
behind them. But when they passed boldly through the great iron gates
and followed the driveway winding over the beautiful lawn, his
bashfulness overcame him, and he sat down on the bank-wall to await
their return, which must be, he fancied, by that same route;
soliloquizing thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Tim, me boy, if it&#8217;s tramps they object to, what
for &#8217;s the use o&#8217; turnin&#8217; your honest self into such?
Them on ahead has business to tend to; the business o&#8217;
makin&#8217; sweet music where music there is none; an&#8217; may the
pennies roll out thick an&#8217; plenteous an&#8217; may the Eyetalian
have the good sense in him to share them same with my sweet colleen.
It&#8217;s thinkin&#8217; I am that all is spent on such as her is
money well invested. So I&#8217;ll enjoy the soft side this well-cut
top-stone, till so be me friends comes along all in a surprise to see
me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>His own whistling had ceased, and though he listened closely he
could not hear Luigi&#8217;s organ or any sound whatever. The truth was
that the way seemed endless from the entrance to the house upon the
terrace; and that having reached it at last, both Luigi and Glory were
dismayed by the magnitude of the mansion and confused by its apparently
countless doorways. Before which they should take their stand, required
time to decide; but unobserved, they finally settled this point. Luigi
rested his instrument upon its pole, loosed Jocko to his gambols, and
tuned up.</p>

<p>The strains which most ears would have found harsh and discordant
sounded pleasantly enough to the listening Timothy, who nodded his head
complacently, wishing and thinking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now he&#8217;s off! May he keep at it till he wheedles not
only the pence but the dollars out the pockets o&#8217; them that
hears! &#8217;Twill take dollars more&#8217;n one to keep Glory on her long
road, safe and fed, and&#8213;Bless us! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>What, indeed, but the wildest sort of uproar, in which angry voices,
the barking of dogs, the screams of frightened women drowning the
feeble tones of &#8220;Oft in the Stilly Night,&#8221; sent Timothy to
his feet and his feet to speeding, not over the graveled driveway, but
straight across the shaven lawn, where passage was forbidden. But no
&#8220;Keep off the grass&#8221; signs deterred him, as he remembered
now, too late, all that he had heard of the ferocity of the Broadacre
dogs which its master kept for just such occasions as this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bloodhounds! And they&#8217;ve loosed them! Oh, me
darlin&#8217; colleen! Ill to me that I let ye go wanderin&#8217; thus
with that miserable Eyetalian! But I&#8217;m comin&#8217;! Tim&#8217;s
comin&#8217;!&#8221; he yelled, adding his own part to the wild chorus
above.</p>

<p>He reached the broad paved space before the great door none too
soon, and though, ordinarily, he would have given the yelping hounds a
very wide berth, he did not hesitate now. Huddled together in a group,
with the frantic animals bounding and barking all around them, though
as yet not touching them, stood the terrified Luigi and his friends;
realizing what vagrancy means in this &#8220;land of the free,&#8221;
and how even to earn an honest living one should never dare to
&#8220;trespass.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even as Timothy forced his stalwart frame between the children
and the dogs, the great door opened and a white-haired gentleman came
hurrying out. Thrusting a silver whistle to his lips he blew upon it
shrilly, and almost instantly the uproar ceased, and the three hounds
sprang to his side, fawning upon him, eager for his commendation.
Instead of praise, however, they were given the word of command and
crouched beside him, licking their jaws and expectant, seemingly, of a
further order to pounce upon the intruders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who loosed the dogs?&#8221; demanded the gentleman, in a
clear-ringing, indignant tone.</p>

<p>Now that he seemed displeased by their too solicitous obedience,
none of the gathering servants laid claim to it; and while all stood
waiting, arrested in their attitudes of fear or defense, a curious
thing happened. Glory Beck threw off the protecting arms of Timothy
Dowd and, with Bonny Angel clasped close in her own, swiftly advanced
to the granite step where the white-haired gentleman stood. Her face
that had paled in fear now flushed in excitement as with a voice unlike
her own she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;You, sir! You, sir! What have you done with my
grandfather?&#8221;</p>

<p>The gentleman stared at her, thinking her fright had turned her
brain; but saying kindly, as soon as he could command his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, child. It&#8217;s all right. The dogs won&#8217;t
touch you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dogs!&#8221; retorted the child, in infinite scorn.
&#8220;What do I care for the dogs? It&#8217;s you I want. You, that
&#8216;Snug-Harbor&#8217;-Bonnicastle-man who coaxed my grandpa Simon Beck
away from his own home an&#8217; never let him come back any
more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then her anger subsiding into an intensity of longing, she threw
herself at his feet, clasping his knees and imploring, piteously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! take me to him. Tell me, tell me where he is. I&#8217;ve
looked so long and I don&#8217;t know where and&#8211;please, please,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment nobody spoke; not even Colonel Bonnicastle, for it was
he, indeed, though he silently motioned to a trustworthy man who had
drawn near to take the dogs away; and who, in obedience, whistling
imperatively, gathered their chains in his hands and led them back to
their kennel.</p>

<p>When the dogs had disappeared, the master of Broadacres sank into a
near-by chair, wiping his brow and pityingly regarded the little girl
who still knelt, imploringly. He was trying to comprehend what had
happened, what she meant, and if he had ever seen her before. Captain
Simon Beck! That was a familiar name, surely, but of that ungrateful
seaman, who wouldn&#8217;t be given a &#8220;Snug Harbor&#8221; whether
or no, of him he had never heard nor even thought since his one
memorable uncomfortable visit to Elbow Lane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simon Beck&#8211;Simon Beck,&#8221; he began, musingly.
&#8220;Yes, I know a Simon Beck, worthy seaman, and would befriend him
if I could. Is he your grandfather, child, and what has happened to him
that you speak to me so&#8211;so&#8211;well, let us
say&#8211;rudely?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he added, in that commanding tone which few who knew him ever
disobeyed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up at once, child. Your kneeling to me is absurd, nor do
I know in what way I can help you, though you think I can do
so&#8211;apparently. Why! How strange&#8211;how like&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had stooped and raised Glory, gently forcing her to her feet, and
as he did so, Bonny Angel turned her own face around from the
girl&#8217;s breast where she had buried it in her terror of the
dogs.</p>

<p>Wasted and shorn of her beautiful hair, clothed in the discarded
rags of a Fogarty twin, it would have taken keen eyes indeed to
recognize in the little outcast the radiant &#8220;Guardian
Angel&#8221; who had flashed upon Glory&#8217;s amazed sight that day
in Elbow Lane; yet something about it there was which made the
near-sighted colonel grope hastily for his eyeglasses and in his haste
overlook them, so that he muttered angrily at his own awkwardness.</p>

<p>Into the blue eyes of the little one herself crept a puzzled
wondering look, that fixed itself upon the perplexed gentleman with a
slowly growing comprehension.</p>

<p>Just then, too, when forgetting her own anxiety, Glory looked from
the baby to the man and back again, startled and wondering, a lady came
to the doorway and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, brother, whatever is the matter! Such an
uproar&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>But her sentence was never finished. Bonny&#8217;s gaze, distracted
from the colonel to his sister, glued itself to the lady&#8217;s face,
while the perplexity in the blue eyes changed to delight. With a
seraphic smile upon her dainty lips, a smile that would have made her
recognizable anywhere, under any disguise, the little creature
propelled herself from Glory&#8217;s arms to the outstretched arms of
Miss Laura, shrilling her familiar announcement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny come! Bonny come!&#8221;</p>

<p>How can the scene be best explained, how best described? Maybe in
words of honest Timothy Dowd himself; who, somewhat later, returning to
the Queen Anne cottage, called the entire Fogarty family about him and
announced to the assembled household:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sirs! Ye could knock me down with a feather!&#8221;
after which he sank into profound silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! And is that what ye&#8217;re wantin&#8217; of us, is it?
Well, you never had sense,&#8221; remarked Mary, turning away
indignantly.</p>

<p>Thus roused, the railroader repeated:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, an&#8217; ye could. A feather&#8217;d do it, an&#8217;
easy. But sit down, woman. Sit down as I bid ye, an&#8217; hear the
most wonderful, marvelous tale a body ever heard this side old Ireland.
Faith, I wish my tongue was twicet as long, an&#8217; I knew better how
to choose the beginnin&#8217; from the end of me story, or the middle
from any one. But sit down, sit down, lass, an&#8217; bid your seven
onruly gossoons to keep the peace for onct, while I tell ye a story
beats all the fairy ones ever dreamed. But&#8211;where to
begin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! I&#8217;ll give you a start,&#8221; answered Mrs.
Fogarty, impatiently. &#8220;You went from here: now go on with your
tale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I went from here,&#8221; began Timothy, obediently, and glad
of even this small aid in his task. &#8220;I went from here an&#8217; I
follyed the three of &#8217;em, monkey an&#8217; man an&#8217;
girl&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the baby. That&#8217;s four,&#8221; corrected Dennis,
junior, winking at a brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hist, boy! Childer should speak when they&#8217;re spoke
to,&#8221; returned Timothy, severely, then continued, at length:
&#8220;I went from here. And I follyed&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he became so lost in retrospection that Mary tapped him on the
shoulder, when he resumed as if no break had occurred:</p>

<p>&#8220;Them four to the gate. But havin&#8217; no business of me own
on the place, I stayed behind, a listenin&#8217;. An&#8217;, purty soon
up pipes the beautiful music; an&#8217; right atop o&#8217; that
comes&#8211;bedlam! All the dogs a barkin&#8217;, the women servants
screeching, the old gentleman commandin&#8217;, and me colleen
huggin&#8217; the Angel tight an&#8217; saying never a say, though the
poor Dago Eyetalian was trembling himself into his grave, till all a
sudden like, up flies Glory, heedin&#8217; dogs nor no dogs, an&#8217;
flings herself at Broadacres&#8217; feet, demanding her grandpa! Fact,
&#8217;twas the same old gentleman she&#8217;d been blamin&#8217; for
spiritin&#8217; away the blind man; and now comes true he knows no more
the sailor&#8217;s whereabouts than them two twinses yon. But
I&#8217;ve me cart afore me horse, as usual. For all along o&#8217;
this, out comes from that elegant mansion another old person, the lady,
Miss Laura Bonnicastle, by your leave. An&#8217; she looks at the Angel
in me colleen&#8217;s arms an&#8217; the Angel looks at her; an&#8217;,
whisht! afore you could wink, out flies the knowin&#8217; baby from the
one to the other! An&#8217; then, bless us! The time there was!
An&#8217; you could hear a pin drop, an&#8217; in a minute you
couldn&#8217;t, along of them questions an&#8217; answers, firing
around, from one person to another, hit-or-miss-like, an&#8217; all
talkin&#8217; to onct, or sayin&#8217; never a word, any one. An&#8217;
so this is the trouble, Mary Fogarty, that Dennis wouldn&#8217;t
mention. The Angel is their own child, and Dennis Fogarty&#8217;s the
clever chap suspicioned it himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Now you&#8217;re fairy-talein&#8217;, indeed. &#8217;Tis old
bachelor and old maid the pair of them is. I know that much if I
don&#8217;t know more,&#8221; returned the house-mistress,
reprovingly.</p>

<p>Timothy was undisturbed and ignored her reproof, as he went on with
his story:</p>

<p>&#8220;Their child was left for them to care for. The only child of
their nevvy an&#8217; niece, who&#8217;s over seas at the minute, a
takin&#8217; a vacation, with hearts broke because of word comin&#8217;
the baby was lost. Lost she was the very day them Bonnicastles set for
leaving the city house an&#8217; comin&#8217; to Broadacres; an&#8217;
intrustin&#8217; the little creatur&#8217; by the care of a
nursemaid&#8211;bad luck to her&#8211;to be took across the big bridge,
over to that Brooklyn where did reside a friend of the whole family
with whom the baby would be safe till called for; meanin&#8217; such
time as them Bonnicastles had done with the movin&#8217; business
an&#8217; could take care of it theirselves, proper. Little
dreamin&#8217; they, poor souls, how that that same nursemaid would
stop to chatter with a friend of her own, right at the bridge-end and
leave the child out of her arms just for the minute, who, set on the
ground by herself, runs off in high glee an&#8217; no more to that
story, till she finds herself in the &#8216;littlest house,&#8217; where me
colleen lived; an&#8217; what come after ye know. But ye don&#8217;t
know how the nursemaid went near daft with the fear, and wasted good
days a searchin&#8217; an&#8217; searchin&#8217; on her own account;
the Bonnicastles&#8217; friend-lady over in Brooklyn not expecting no
such visit an&#8217; not knowin&#8217; aught; &#8217;cause the maid carried
the note sayin&#8217; so in her own pocket. All them rich folks
bein&#8217; so intimate-like, preparin&#8217; &#8217;em wasn&#8217;t
needful. And then, when the truth out, all the police in the city set
to the hunt, and word sent across the ocean to the
ravin&#8217;-distracted young parents, an&#8217;&#8211;now, all&#8217;s
right! Such joy, such thanksgivin&#8217;, such cryin&#8217; an&#8217;
laughin&#8217;&#8211;bless us! I couldn&#8217;t mention it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that poor little Glory! Hard on her to find the
Angel&#8217;s folks an&#8217; not her own!&#8221; said Mary,
gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not hard a bit! She&#8217;s that onselfish like,
&#8217;twould have done you proud to see her clappin&#8217; her hands
an&#8217; smilin&#8217;, though the tears yet in her eyes, &#8217;cause she
an&#8217; Bonny must part. And &#8216;How&#8217;s that?&#8217; asks Miss
Laura, catching the girl to her heart and kissin&#8217; her ill-cropped
head, &#8216;do you think we will not stand by you in your search and help
you with money and time and every service, you who have been so
faithful to our darlin&#8217;?&#8217; And then the pair o&#8217; them
huggin&#8217; each other, like they&#8217;d loved each other sence the
day they was born.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, for sheer want of breath, Timothy&#8217;s narrative ended, but
Mary having a vivid imagination, allowed it full play then and
prophesied, sagely and happily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, all of ye listen, till I tell ye how &#8217;twill
be. That old man was run over in the street was Captain Simon Beck; and
though he was hurted bad, he wasn&#8217;t killed; and though them
clever little newsboys couldn&#8217;t find him, the folks Colonel
Bonnicastle sets searchin&#8217; will. An&#8217; when he&#8217;s found,
he&#8217;ll be nigh well; an&#8217; he&#8217;ll be brought out here
an&#8217; kep&#8217; in a little cottage somewhere on Broadacres
property, with Glory to tend him an&#8217; to live happy ever
afterward. An&#8217; that&#8217;ll be the only &#8216;Snug Harbor&#8217; any
one&#8217;ll ever need. An&#8217; we shan&#8217;t have lost our Glory
but got her for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But them Billy Button and Nick Parson boys, what of
them?&#8221; demanded Dennis, junior, his own sympathy running toward
the clever gamins.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll come too, if they want to. They&#8217;ll come,
all the same, now and again, just for vari&#8217;ty like,&#8221; comfortably
assented his mother. &#8220;An&#8217; your father&#8217;ll get well,
an&#8217; we&#8217;ll move into that other house down yon, further from
the big one; an&#8217; them Bonnicastles&#8217;ll fix this up prime
an&#8217; Glory&#8217;ll live here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it ought to be, an&#8217; that we all should live happy
forever an&#8217; a day!&#8221; cried Timothy, enjoying her finish of
his tale more than he had his own part in it.</p>

<p>And so, in truth it all happened, and Mary&#8217;s cheerful prophecy
was fulfilled in due time.</p>

<p>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS AROUND THE WORLD.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>Could Jules Verne have dreamed of encircling the globe with a motor cycle for
emergencies he would have deemed it an achievement greater than any he describes
in his account of the amusing travels of Philias Fogg. This, however, is the
purpose successfully carried out by the Motor Cycle Chums, and the tale of their
mishaps, hindrances and delays is one of intense interest, secret amusement, and
incidental information to the reader.</p>

<p>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS OF THE NORTHWEST PATROL.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>The Great Northwest is a section of vast possibilities and in it the Motor
Cycle Chums meet adventures even more unusual and exciting than many of their
experiences on their tour around the world. There is not a dull page in this
lively narrative of clever boys and their attendant &#8220;Chinee.&#8221;</p>

<p>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS IN THE GOLD FIELDS.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>The gold fever which ran its rapid course through the veins of the historic
&#8220;forty-niners&#8221; recurs at certain intervals, and seizes its victims
with almost irresistible power. The search for gold is so fascinating to the
seekers that hardship, danger and failure are obstacles that scarcely dampen
their ardour. How the Motor Cycle Chums were caught by the lure of the gold and
into what difficulties and novel experiences they were led, makes a tale of
thrilling interest.</p>

<p>THE GIRL AVIATORS AND THE PHANTOM AIRSHIP.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>Roy Prescott was fortunate in having a sister so clever and devoted to him
and his interests that they could share work and play with mutual pleasure and
to mutual advantage. This proved especially true in relation to the manufacture
and manipulation of their aeroplane, and Peggy won well deserved fame for her
skill and good sense as an aviator. There were many stumbling-blocks in their
terrestrial path, but they soared above them all to ultimate success.</p>

<p>THE GIRL AVIATORS ON GOLDEN WINGS.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that wins and holds girl
enthusiasts as well as boys is proved by this tale. On golden wings the girl
aviators rose for many an exciting flight, and met strange and unexpected
experiences.</p>

<p>THE GIRL AVIATORS&#8217; SKY CRUISE.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an adventure. How much more
perilous an adventure a &#8220;sky cruise&#8221; might be is suggested by the
title and proved by the story itself.</p>

<p>THE GIRL AVIATORS&#8217; MOTOR BUTTERFLY.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>The delicacy of flight suggested by the word &#8220;butterfly,&#8221; the
mechanical power implied by &#8220;motor,&#8221; the ability to control assured
in the title &#8220;aviator,&#8221; all combined with the personality and
enthusiasm of girls themselves, make this story one for any girl or other reader
&#8220;to go crazy over.&#8221;</p>

<p>THE MOTOR MAIDS&#8217; SCHOOL DAYS.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>Billie Campbell was just the type of a straightforward, athletic girl to be
successful as a practical Motor Maid. She took her car, as she did her
class-mates, to her heart, and many a grand good time did they have all
together. The road over which she ran her red machine had many an unexpected
turning,&#8211;now it led her into peculiar danger; now into contact with
strange travelers; and again into experiences by fire and water. But, best of
all, &#8220;The Comet&#8221; never failed its brave girl owner.</p>

<p>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM AND PINE.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>Wherever the Motor Maids went there were lively times, for these were
companionable girls who looked upon the world as a vastly interesting place full
of unique adventures&#8211;and so, of course, they found them.</p>

<p>THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully entertaining to see
old scenes through fresh eyes. It is that privilege, therefore, that makes it
worth while to join the Motor Maids in their first &#8217;cross-country run.</p>

<p>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND HEATHER.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor could their education by
travel have been more wisely begun. But now a speaking acquaintance with their
own country enriched their anticipation of an introduction to the British Isles.
How they made their polite American bow and how they were received on the other
side is a tale of interest and inspiration.</p>

<p>THE BOY INVENTORS&#8217; WIRELESS TELEGRAPH.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>Blest with natural curiosity,&#8211;sometimes called the instinct of
investigation,&#8211;favored with golden opportunity, and gifted with creative
ability, the Boy Inventors meet emergencies and contrive mechanical wonders that
interest and convince the reader because they always &#8220;work&#8221; when put
to the test.</p>

<p>THE BOY INVENTORS&#8217; VANISHING GUN.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>A thought, a belief, an experiment; discouragement, hope, effort and final
success&#8211;this is the history of many an invention; a history in which
excitement, competition, danger, despair and persistence figure. This merely
suggests the circumstances which draw the daring Boy Inventors into strange
experiences and startling adventures, and which demonstrate the practical use of
their vanishing gun.</p>

<p>THE BOY INVENTORS&#8217; DIVING TORPEDO BOAT.</p>

<p class='ti2 fss'>As in the previous stories of the Boy Inventors, new and interesting triumphs
of mechanism are produced which become immediately valuable, and the stage for
their proving and testing is again the water. On the surface and below it, the
boys have jolly, contagious fun, and the story of their serious, purposeful
inventions challenge the reader&#8217;s deepest attention.</p>

Old World can furnish a better setting for romantic action than the Border of
the New.</p>

exigencies of their life in connection with the Texas Rangers demand all their

airmen.</p>

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
